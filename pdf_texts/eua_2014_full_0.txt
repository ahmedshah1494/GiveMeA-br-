PReFACe

t was 9 October 2012. The school bus, a converted truck, had
travelled only a few hundred yards from Khushal school in Mingora,
north-west Pakistan, when a masked man stepped in front of the
vehicle. An accomplice armed with a pistol climbed onto the tailgate at
the rear, leaned over and asked which of the 20 schoolgirls huddled
inside was Malala. When the driver stepped on the accelerator, the
gunman opened fire, shooting Malala in the head.1

I

Malala Yousafzai, 15, had become well known in the
area – and a Pakistani Taliban target – after daring to
speak out against the militants’ edict banning girls
from attending classes and their bombing of schools.2
Critically wounded by a bullet that tore through her
head and shoulder and lodged near her spine, she
was rushed by helicopter to a military hospital in
Peshawar, along with two wounded school friends.
From there, she was taken to England, where she has
made a remarkable recovery and now lives.
Hailed by international media and feted by human
rights groups for her courage, Malala is today famous
around the world. But she is just one of the many
thousands of students, teachers, academics and
other education personnel in dozens of countries
targeted with violence.
This global study charts the scale and nature of
attacks on education; highlights their impact on
education – including on students, teachers and
facilities; and documents the ways that governments,
local communities, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) and UN agencies try to reduce the impact of
such violence and prevent future attacks.
In doing so, it provides the most extensive
documentation of attacks on education to date.

4

Following earlier studies that UNESCO published in
2007 and 2010,3 it not only examines attacks on
schools, as previous research has done, but also
considers military use of education facilities and more
closely examines attacks on higher education.
The study’s four main aims are to: better inform
international and national efforts to prevent schools,
universities, students, teachers, academics and other
education staff from being attacked; encourage the
investigation, prosecution and punishment of the
perpetrators of attacks; share knowledge about
effective responses; and help those who have been
attacked to recover and rebuild their lives – as
Malala is doing – by providing recommendations for
action that the international community, governments
and armed non-state groups should adopt and
implement.
In July 2013, Malala addressed the UN General
Assembly and stressed the importance of protecting
education. ‘The terrorists thought that they would
change my aims and stop my ambitions,’ she said,
‘but nothing changed in my life, except this:
weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Let us pick up
our books and pens. They are our most powerful
weapons.’4

SUMMARY
his global study examines threats or deliberate use of
force against students, teachers, academics, education
trade union members, government officials, aid workers
and other education staff, and against schools, universities

It focuses on targeted attacks by state military and security
forces and armed non-state groups on education facilities,
students or staff, not death, injury or destruction resulting from
being caught in crossfire.
It does not examine school attacks by lone armed individuals
with none of the above-listed motives or affiliations, such as the
school shooting at Sandy Hook in the United States in 2012.

SUMMARY

This study, which follows earlier studies
published by UNeSCO in 2007 and 2010, is the
most comprehensive examination of attacks on
education to date. Based on extensive data
gathering for the period 2009-2012 and information on key incidents in the first nine months
of 2013, it finds that over the past five years,
armed non-state groups, state military and
security forces, and armed criminal groups have
attacked thousands of schoolchildren,
university students, teachers, academics and
education establishments in at least 70
countries worldwide.
The study reports in detail on 30 countries where there was a
significant pattern of attacks in the five-year reporting period
and lists 40 other countries where isolated attacks took place.
It concludes that targeted attacks on education and incidents
of military use of schools and universities are occurring in far
more countries and far more extensively than previously
documented. It is not known whether this reflects growing
awareness of the problem and more and better reporting of
such attacks since the earlier studies were published or an
actual increase in the number of attacks.
Many attacks involve bombing or burning schools or universities, or killing, injuring, kidnapping, or illegally arresting,
detaining or torturing students, teachers and academics.
Hundreds have died as a result and hundreds of thousands
more have missed out on the right to an education. In many
places, children and young people, and those who teach them,
live in fear of attacks.
The 30 countries profiled all have five or more incidents or
victims including at least one direct attack on a school or the
killing of at least one teacher, student or academic. They are:
Afghanistan, Bahrain, Central African Republic (CAR),
Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Israel/Palestine, Kenya, Libya, Mali, Mexico, Myanmar,
Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, Somalia, South
Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, Yemen and Zimbabwe.
The 40 other countries where isolated attacks were reported
are: Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Belarus, Brazil, Cambodia,
Chad, Chile, China, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador,

France, Georgia, Guatemala, Haiti, Ireland, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia,
Malawi, Maldives, Malaysia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea,

Venezuela and Vietnam.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

‘School teachers?
We will kill them!’
In Nigeria, from January to September 2013, some 30 teachers were
reportedly shot dead, sometimes during class. The Associated Press
reported that in a video statement made in July 2013, Abubakar Shekau,
leader of the militant Islamist group Boko Haram, threatened teachers,
saying: ‘School teachers who are teaching Western education? We will
kill them! We will kill them!’; he also endorsed recent school attacks and
claimed that non-Islamic schools should be burned down. Boko Haram,
whose commonly used name means ‘Western education is a sin’ in
Hausa, has sought to impose a strict form of Sharia, or Islamic law, in
northern Nigeria and partially destroyed or burned down 50 schools in
the first seven months of 2013, according to Amnesty International.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

The study differs from previous publications of Education
under Attack in 2007 and 2010: it covers a different length of
time; significantly more resources were employed to
undertake the research; and it set out to provide extensive
coverage of a wider range of incidents. In particular, there is an
additional focus on military use of education buildings and
facilities and on attacks on higher education, compared to the
two earlier studies. It is difficult, therefore, to draw conclusions
about trends over time when comparing the data of this study
with those of previous studies.

School torched
by a sectarian mob
education in Myanmar faced a new and violent threat
from Buddhist nationalists in central and eastern
regions in 2013 as schools and students were attacked
in outbursts of sectarian violence. In one incident in
March 2013, a 200-strong mob of Buddhists marched on
a Muslim school in Meiktila, according to media reports.
The teachers heard that they were coming and took the
students out into a patch of bush near the school to
hide. When the mob reached the school they torched it
and went looking for the students. When they found
them, they clubbed them with staves and, in some
cases, poured petrol on them and set them alight. They
decapitated one student after they caught him hiding in
the undergrowth. In total, 32 students and four teachers
were killed. Seven Buddhists were later jailed in
connection with the school massacre.

The research team gathered data for this study from a wide
range of secondary sources – including United Nations (UN)
monitoring and reporting, research by human rights groups
and media reports – with differing purposes and varying levels
and methods of verification. Additional data were gathered by
information requests sent to UN agencies and international
and local NGOs; phone interviews with in-country experts; and
in some cases via further in-country research by experienced
human rights researchers and journalists. The findings from
the different sources have been collated, summarized and
cross-checked against each other for reliability and accuracy.
The study was also extensively reviewed by
experts in human rights, international law,
education-in-emergencies and research
methodology. However, it has not been
possible to verify every incident.
The study gauges the scale and nature of
violent attacks on education in the 30 profiled
countries, as well as military use of schools and
universities. It also examines their impact on
education and the responses that communities
and governments, with support from national
and international agencies, have taken to
address the problem, drawing upon a
cumulative understanding of the impact of
attacks since the issue was first studied
globally and examining good practices across
the world.

SUMMARY

The countries very heavily affected — where reports
documented 1,000 or more attacks on schools, universities,
staff and students or 1,000 or more students, teachers or other
education personnel attacked or education buildings attacked
or used for military purposes in 2009-2012 — were
Afghanistan, Colombia, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan and Syria.
For example, during that time period:
• In Afghanistan, according to the UN, there were 1,110 or
more attacks on school-level education, including arson
attacks, explosions and suicide bombings. Staff were
threatened, killed and kidnapped.
• In Colombia, one of the most dangerous places to be a
teacher, 140 teachers were killed over these four years
and 1,086 received death threats, according to the
Ministry of Education. In addition, 305 were forced to
leave their homes because their lives were at risk,
according to the Escuela Nacional Sindical (ENS), a
prominent Colombian NGO monitoring labour rights.
• In Pakistan, armed groups, particularly the Pakistani
Taliban, attacked at least 838 schools, mostly by blowing
up school buildings, and deprived hundreds of
thousands of children of access to education, according
to primary research by the independent Human Rights
Commission of Pakistan. Some 30 school students and
20 teachers were killed and 97 school students and eight
teachers injured, and 138 school students and staff were
kidnapped. One higher education student and four
academics were killed, and dozens of university students
were injured.
Other heavily affected countries — where reports documented
between 500 and 999 attacks on schools, universities, staff
and students or between 500 and 999 students, teachers or
other education personnel attacked or education buildings
attacked or used for military purposes in 2009-2012 — were
Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Libya, Mexico and
Yemen.
For instance, in Yemen there were 720 incidents involving the
use of force or violence affecting schools in 2009-2012. In Côte
d’Ivoire in 2010-2011, 50 university students were attacked
and several university facilities occupied and, in 2011, armed
groups destroyed, damaged, looted or used at least 477
schools during post-election violence.

14

However, in all of these countries, the
exact number of attacks in which
education facilities, students or staff were
targeted is unclear, due to the lack of
specificity of available information.
Some individual incidents resulted in
large numbers of casualties. For instance,
in Somalia in October 2011, an AlShabaab suicide bomber exploded a
truck filled with drums of fuel outside a
compound in Mogadishu housing the
education ministry and other ministries,
killing 100 or more people, many of whom
were students and parents. In a prerecorded message, the bomber reportedly
said he was targeting the students, who
were due to gather at the Ministry of
Education to obtain examination results
needed for scholarships to study abroad.
The reported motives for targeting
schools, students, teachers and other
education staff include the desire to:
• destroy symbols of government
control or demonstrate control over
an area by an anti-government
group;
• block the education of girls, or any
type of education perceived to teach
or impose alien religious or cultural
values, biased history or an
unfamiliar language of instruction;
• restrict teacher trade union activity
and academic freedom;
• abduct children for use as
combatants, sex slaves or logistical
support in military operations, or
abduct students and teachers for
ransom; or
• seize schools and universities for use as barracks and
bases or firing positions, or attack schools because they
are being used for these purposes by opposing forces.

Students used
as human shields
In Somalia, armed militants used schools as bases to launch
attacks on opposing forces, making them targets for attack
while students and teachers were still inside. According to
Human Rights Watch in their 2012 report No place for children:
Child recruitment, forced marriage and attacks on schools in
Somalia, in some cases the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab
locked frightened students and teachers in school, using them
as human shields while they launched artillery attacks from
behind the school or from school grounds against forces of the
Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and African Union
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). One primary school student
reported in 2010 that he was in class when Al-Shabaab fighters
started firing what seemed to be rockets from just behind the
school while classes were ongoing. ‘AMISOM/TFG started
responding…. The school was hit by a weapon that sounded
like a thunder when coming and then made a big explosion,’ he
told Human Rights Watch. Three children died in the attack and
six were injured.

Military use of education institutions
School and university facilities were used for military purposes
in 24 of the 30 countries profiled during 2009-2012:
Afghanistan, CAR, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Egypt,
Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Kenya, Libya,
Mali, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines, Somalia, South
Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Yemen and Zimbabwe.
The country with by far the most reported incidents was Syria,
where military use from the conflict spiked in 2011-2012.
Although it does not specify exact figures, the UN reported
numerous incidents of government forces using schools as
temporary bases or detention centres and there were allegations that the Free Syrian Army used schools in a number of
areas as bases and as places to store ammunition during this
period. Furthermore, the Syrian Network for Human Rights

alleged in mid-January 2013 that government
forces had used approximately 1,000 schools
as detention and torture centres and used
schools to house security and intelligence
personnel or as positions from which to shell
the surrounding area. It is assumed that nearly
all of these incidents took place before 2013,
although there is insufficient evidence to
confirm this.
Beyond Syria, in the other 14 countries with the
highest reported incidence of military use in
2009-2012 – Afghanistan, CAR, Colombia, Côte
d’Ivoire, DRC, India, Libya, Mali, Pakistan, the
Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Thailand
and Yemen – armed groups, armed forces,
police forces and international forces used a
total of 923 or more schools and universities for
military purposes in those four years. In Libya,
for example, armed groups reportedly used 221
schools during the 2011 uprising; and in eastern
and north-eastern India in 2010, government
forces reportedly used at least 129 schools as
barracks or bases in their conflict with Maoist
insurgents and other armed groups.
Across the countries where military use
occurred, schools and universities were used as
barracks to house soldiers or fighters or as
bases to mount security operations. They also
served as fighting positions, prisons or
detention centres, interrogation or torture sites
and places to store weapons. School buildings were
additionally used as places to indoctrinate, recruit and train
students in some places. In Mali, for instance, children as
young as 11 were reportedly trained by armed groups in
private, public and Koranic schools.
State armed forces and armed non-state groups jeopardize the
lives of students and teachers or other personnel when they
use schools and universities for military purposes without
evacuating them first, because the military presence could
well draw enemy fire. In many cases, military use leads to
learning being disrupted or halted altogether, as parents
withdraw their children, fearing for their safety, or the school is
closed. Even if the schools are empty, military use can damage
facilities or lead to those schools being destroyed in subsequent attacks.

SUMMARY

Recruitment of children and sexual
violence at schools or along school routes
This study addresses child recruitment and sexual violence
only to the extent that such abuses happened at schools or
along school routes. Armed groups and armed forces
sometimes specifically target such locations because they
know they will find children there.
Reported evidence of armed groups and armed criminal groups
recruiting children while they were in school or as they travelled
to or from school was found in six countries during 2009-2012:
Colombia, DRC, Pakistan, Somalia, Thailand and Yemen.
Recruitment happened for a variety of reasons. In Colombia, for
example, child recruits were used by armed groups as spies or
to transport arms or pass on messages to other students in
schools, as well as to run their drug business inside schools. In
Pakistan, militants recruited, lured or abducted children from
mainstream schools and madrassas (religious schools), in
some cases to train as suicide bombers.
Recruitment methods included indoctrination programmes at
school, threatening to kill students if they did not join,
abduction en route to schools and rounding up students at

schools. In Colombia, armed groups waited outside schools to
talk to children, find out information, and recruit and control
them; in Yemen, Houthi rebels used students and teachers to
recruit children; and in DRC, a breakaway rebel group
abducted children en masse from school to fill their ranks.
The strongest evidence of systematic recruitment from schools
was found in Somalia, where the UN reported that Al-Shabaab
abducted 2,000 children for military training in 2010 and
recruited another 948 in 2011, mostly from schools. Human
Rights Watch reported cases of Al-Shabaab abducting girls
from schools for forced marriage to fighters. In one case,
militants beheaded a 16-year-old who refused to marry a
commander much older than her and brought her head back to
be shown to the remaining girls at the school as a warning.
There were also isolated reports of sexual violence by armed
forces or armed groups at or en route to or from schools in DRC
and Somalia in 2009-2012. Two incidents in CAR and India
were also reported in 2012-2013. These types of attacks may be
more widespread, but public reporting of sexual violence is
often very limited and, when it does occur, tends to lack information about whether the violence took place en route to or
from or at school.

Children seized at school
According to Human Rights Watch, in April 2012 in DRC, followers of the rebel
general Bosco Ntaganda, formerly of the Congolese Army, raided Mapendano
secondary school in North Kivu province and seized 32 male students. It was one of
their methods of forcibly recruiting school students when villagers refused to hand
over their sons. A 17-year-old student told Human Rights Watch that fighters entered
his school at the end of classes, took them outside, tied up their hands and marched
the students off the premises to join the forces fighting for Ntaganda. At a military
camp, they were given some training. Recruits who resisted were beaten and others
were told they would be killed if they tried to escape. In one case, a 16-year-old
recruit told Human Rights Watch that at night Ntaganda’s men ‘put grenades on us
and told us that if we moved, they would explode’. Back in the villages, fear of
recruitment led many boys and young men to flee across the border into Rwanda.

Attacks on higher education
The study found attacks on higher education facilities,
students and academics and military use of universities were
reported in 28 of the 30 profiled countries in 2009-2012. The
exceptions were CAR and Mali.
Unlike most attacks on schools, violent attacks on higher
education frequently take place in non-conflict situations –
although they do also occur in countries affected by war – and
more often involve arbitrary arrest, detention or persecution of
particular students and teachers.
Many attacks on higher education are linked to government
attempts to prevent the growth of opposition movements;
restrict political protests, including those related to education
policy; stop anti-government protests on campus; quell
education trade union activity; or curtail the freedom of
lecturers and researchers to explore or discuss sensitive

subjects or alternative views to government policy. As with
violence against school students and teachers, attacks on
higher education can also involve sectarian bias and targeting
of ethnic groups.
During 2009-2013, most attacks on education buildings were
directed at school facilities rather than those used for higher
education. However, higher education facilities were attacked
in at least 17 countries: Afghanistan, Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Egypt,
Iran, Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Libya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan,
the Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and
Yemen. In Mexico, for example, a group opposing nanotechnology research reportedly bombed six campuses and
research laboratories and threatened six others in 2011; and in
Syria, two explosions at Aleppo University killed at least 82
and wounded dozens more, possibly as many as 150, on the
first day of mid-term examinations in January 2013.

Students’ convoy targeted
In May 2010, at least 100 students were injured when a convoy of buses
was attacked, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq
(UNAMI). The buses were transporting college students from Christian
towns and villages on the Nineveh Plain back to classes at the University of
Mosul and were being escorted by Iraqi forces. A car bomb exploded as the
first buses crossed a checkpoint along the internal border between the
semi-autonomous Kurdish region and the rest of the country. Shortly
afterwards, another roadside bomb went off, according to the New York
Times. The area around Mosul University had already experienced several
attacks and threats of attacks in 2009, which is why students travelled in
these types of convoys. The attacks on Christian students were part of a
spate of dozens of attacks against Christians in Iraq in 2010. According to
Worldwatch Monitor, nearly 1,000 students stayed away from class for the
rest of the semester as a result of the convoy attack.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Where armed groups were the perpetrators, bombings were
among the most common incidents, along with assassinations
and kidnappings. State security forces also resorted to
arbitrary arrest or detention and excessive force that, at times,
resulted in death and injury. There were incidents of state
armed forces or security services, rebel groups and guerrillas
taking over or shutting down universities as well.
The largest number of higher education student casualties
during 2009-2012 was in Yemen where more than 73 were
killed and more than 139 injured in 2011, although it is not
known how many were targeted. The largest number of
arbitrary arrests of students was reported in Sudan where
more than 1,040 were arrested by security agents, the majority
of them in protests related to education or which began at, or
took place at, education institutions, according to human
rights and media reports.
Some of the most serious incidents involved raids by security
forces or armed groups on student dormitories or other forms
of campus residence in Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Sudan and Syria. In September 2013, gunmen
stormed a dormitory in the middle of the night at a college in
Yobe, Nigeria, killing as many as 50 students. In 2011 and
2012, security forces in Syria raided dormitories at Aleppo and
Damascus universities, killing seven students, injuring 49 and
arresting 330, according to media reports. In Sudan, some 450
student rooms at Omdurman Islamic University in Khartoum
were reportedly set on fire by security agents and supporters of
the National Congress Party in December 2012.

Long-term impact of attacks
In some countries, education authorities or NGOs have
documented the number of schools damaged or destroyed, or
the number of teachers or students killed or injured. But information is scant regarding the way such attacks affect the
provision of education in the long term, let alone their wider
social and economic impact. The study’s discussion of longterm impacts, therefore, is not restricted to situations where
attacks took place during the reporting period but draws on
experiences in countries where attacks have been documented
in the past as well.
Where attacks on schools, students and teachers are
persistent or the use of force – real or threatened – blocks
recovery from attacks, the effects, which impinge on student
attainment and access to good-quality education, can include:

• persistent demotivation and distraction of students,
teachers and other education staff by fear or psychological distress or trauma;
• chronic disruption of attendance or permanent drop-out
of students, teachers and other education staff;
• falling recruitment of staff, leading to teacher shortages,
and declining enrolment of students, hindering national
and global attempts to achieve Education for All (EFA),
the drive to achieve universal primary education and
other important educational goals.
All these effects have short-, medium- and long-term dimensions but the longer attacks persist or violence blocks recovery,
the deeper and more lasting the effects are likely to be.
In countries where attacks have persisted on a significant scale
year after year – many countries experienced attacks on
education long before the start of this study’s reporting period
– lengthy school closure has meant that hundreds of
thousands of children have been denied access to education,
sometimes for months or sometimes for years. For instance, in
Yemen, 54 schools were closed for up to two months after 143
attacks on education in 2011, affecting 182,000 students. In
Afghanistan, the Ministry of Education reported that more than
590 schools were closed in vulnerable areas as of May 2012,
compared to 800 or more in 2009. In some cases, security
threats or prolonged military use block them from being rebuilt
or reopened, as in India where by 2009 police had occupied
some schools for three years and one for a decade, and in
South Sudan, where armed forces occupied some schools for
up to five years. Often, where schools are damaged or
destroyed, the government lacks the capacity or will to rebuild
in a timely manner.
In higher education, attacks may not only endanger lives and
disrupt education, but also prove devastating for research and
teaching by triggering fear, flight and self-censorship among
whole academic communities. They also disrupt training of
teachers, education planners and managers.
Attacks on education can also exact a psychological toll, in the
short or long term, including distraction, distress and impaired
ability to study or teach.
Wider and long-term consequences for society include
restricting development and – particularly in the case of
attacks on higher education – hindering the emergence and
strengthening of political plurality, accountable government
and open democracy.

SUMMARY

Response and prevention
So what can be done to stop attacks on education and how can
their impact be limited? Although more information has been
gathered on prevention and response since the last Education
under Attack study was published in 2010, rigorous empirical
and comparative research into the effectiveness of different
measures is still lacking, in part due to the major methodological challenges of conducting such research. A clearer
understanding is still needed of exactly what the relative
advantages of one intervention over another are, given the
nature of attacks, their perpetrators and motives; the
particular context; and the potential negative side effects and
unintended consequences. Nevertheless, there are examples
of measures that have been taken to respond to and prevent
attacks, both before and during this study’s reporting period,
by international agencies, national governments, NGOs and
communities.

Monitoring and reporting
Effective monitoring, assessment and reporting are crucial for
ensuring that governments, UN agencies and NGOs take
appropriate prevention and response measures. One of the
most significant developments during the reporting period
was the passing of UN Security Council Resolution 1998 in July
2011, which made attacks on schools and school personnel a
trigger for listing in the annexes to the UN Secretary-General’s
annual report on children and armed conflict. This, in turn,
requires the violating parties to develop action plans to end
such attacks or face consequences that can include targeted
sanctions applied by the UN Security Council.
The passing of Resolution 1998 has ensured that the UN pays
greater attention to attacks on schools and teachers in
monitoring and reporting carried out by Country Task Forces of
the UN-led Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) on
grave violations against children in situations of armed
conflict. However, so far the MRM has operated in a limited
number of countries – typically around 13-14 in any given year.
It did operate in many of the very heavily or heavily affected
countries, but it did not operate in all of them, or in a number of
other profiled countries in which a significant pattern of
attacks on education took place. This was partly because the
activation of the MRM requires a high standard of UN verification of incidents and identification of perpetrators.
Moreover, its remit only allows it to operate in situations of
armed conflict and a number of countries with a significant

24

number of attacks on education are not recognized as situations of conflict, such as Mexico and Zimbabwe.
In most countries affected by attacks on education, there is still
a need to strengthen monitoring and reporting partnerships
between UN agencies, international and national NGOs and
education ministries and district education offices to improve
data collection on attacks on schools (including data on the
long-term impact on education) and verification.
There is also a pressing need to fill the gap in global monitoring
and reporting of attacks on higher education. Monitoring such
attacks is not part of the remit of the UN-led MRM, which
focuses on grave violations against children and therefore
school-level incidents only.

Accountability and ending impunity
International human rights law, international humanitarian
law and international criminal law provide a strong legal
framework for protecting education, depending on the context.
However, impunity for those responsible for attacking
education is a persistent problem and urgently needs to be
addressed at national and international levels. Very few investigations of attacks or prosecutions of perpetrators have been
documented.
Achieving a reduction in or an end to the use of schools and
universities for military purposes may significantly reduce the
number of education institutions put at risk of attack, because
military use makes them a potential target. International
humanitarian law restricts the use of schools and universities
in support of a military effort, but it does not prohibit such use
in all circumstances.
Some countries have taken the important step of introducing
legislation, jurisprudence or military policies restricting, and
in some cases completely prohibiting, the military use of
schools or universities, although this injunction is not consistently enforced. Examples include Colombia, India, the
Philippines and, most recently, South Sudan, which in August
2013 issued a military order prohibiting its armed forces from
using schools for military purposes.
A positive step is the current effort, which the Global Coalition
to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA) has galvanized, to
develop international guidelines – the Lucens Guidelines for
Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during
Armed Conflict. The intention is that when a state adopts the
Guidelines they will incorporate them into their domestic legislation and military doctrine, thereby making them binding via

Partnerships for
monitoring and reporting
During the post-election crisis in Côte d’Ivoire from December 2010 to June
2011, dozens of schools were attacked. The education Cluster worked with
the Ministry of education to set up a national survey of 9,000 schools to
assess the impact of attacks on education nationally.
According to the Global education Cluster, the education ministry and
district education authorities encouraged the involvement of teachers in
every village to collect data for the survey by hand and by email. They
looked for information on schools being used for military purposes or as
shelters for internally displaced people, the destruction and looting of
schools, forced closure of schools due to threats of violence, incidents of
explosions and attacks on students.

The survey found 477 schools had been destroyed, damaged or looted, or
used by armed and military groups: of these, 180 schools were looted, 173
destroyed, burned down or damaged and 20 schools were attacked by
bombs. The information was later used to press for an end to military use of
schools. By November 2011, armed groups had vacated 45 schools as a
result of negotiations, according to a GCPeA study.

domestic law. If many countries can be persuaded to follow
suit, significant progress could be made towards reducing the
number of schools put at risk of attack and the number of
students whose safety is threatened – and whose learning is
compromised – by the presence of troops and weapons in their
classrooms.

Military and security responses
Some military forces, education authorities and communities
have taken physical protection measures to secure schools
and teachers against attack. These include assigning armed or
unarmed guards to education institutions; establishing checkpoints near schools; reinforcing school infrastructure such as
building walls around school perimeters; providing housing for
students or personnel on campus or nearby; providing a
protective presence or escorts to accompany students or
teachers en route to and from schools; offering safer modes of
transportation; and arming teachers. Many of
these measures have been taken in Thailand’s
far south, for instance. Unarmed guards have
been used in Afghanistan.
Not all measures have proven effective. In some
contexts, measures such as security escorts may
be counterproductive and increase the
likelihood of teachers or schools being targeted
because it offers armed groups the opportunity
to target both soldiers and teachers in the same
incident. In southern Thailand, for instance,
there have been many attacks against troops
providing protection for teachers en route to
school in which either troops or troops and
teachers have been killed.

Negotiated solutions
In some cases, local community leaders, armed
groups or government forces, government
officials or external actors have negotiated with
attacking parties to prevent or end attacks or
military use of education facilities, for example,
in DRC and South Sudan where occupying forces
agreed to vacate schools.

Community responses
Communities have contributed to protection in a range of ways.
In Afghanistan, this has involved school management
committees in protecting schools, students and teachers;
setting up school defence committees; providing nightwatchmen; and running community schools or offering classes
in people’s homes, which are less likely to be attacked. In
Liberia, it has involved parents providing student escorts; in
Gaza, a community alert system was established; in Mexico,
teacher trade unions led protests demanding better security
measures; in Nepal, community members led negotiations to
ensure schools were respected by both sides in the conflict as
zones of peace; and in Côte d’Ivoire, local head teachers
helped in the monitoring of attacks.

Tailored protection
for teachers at risk
In Colombia, a Working Group on the Human Rights of
Teachers, composed of the Office of the High Commissioner
for Human Rights (OHCHR) and representatives from the
Colombian government and the teacher trade unions,
provided support to threatened or targeted teachers,
university academics and trade union leaders through
various protection measures. Working on a case-by-case
basis, special committees studied the type and degree of risk
and the mode of protection that would be most effective,
including armed escorts or guards, mobile phones, bulletproof vehicles and temporary relocation, a 2009 education
International study reported. In 2010, the government
offered teachers at risk ‘provisional status’ so that they could
relocate rapidly while they waited for police to carry out a risk
assessment. According to the National Ministry of education,
of the 600 teaching staff who reported receiving death
threats in 2011, 38 left the country, 282 were given
temporary transfers and 38 were transferred permanently.

SUMMARY

Addressing education’s role in conflict
In the far south of Thailand, ethnic Malay Muslim insurgent groups have attacked schools
at least in part due to their perception that schools have in the past been used as a means
to impose Buddhism, Thai language and Thai versions of history on ethnic Malay
Muslims. Some 59 teachers were assassinated in 2009-2012.
The education authorities decided that protection against attacks on schools and assassinations of teachers could be increased by making changes to the curriculum and adopting
staffing policies that help build relations with the local community.
Major changes included increasing by five-fold the number of hours of Islamic religious
instruction and switching from a five-day to a six-day week to accommodate the extra
lessons; recruiting thousands of Malay Muslim teachers locally instead of relying on
bringing in Thai Buddhist teachers from outside the area, who are the main targets of
attack; and incorporating the teaching of english and the local Malay language.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Education policy and planning
In countries at risk of conflict, addressing education-related
grievances can play an important part in reducing the risk of
attacks on schools, students and education personnel. Where
unequal access is a source of tension, education authorities
can address the problem by ensuring that there are fair criteria
for allocating resources. Where curricula are perceived to be
biased against one ethnic group because classes are taught in
an alien language or because alien cultural values, a different
religion or distorted history are being taught, curriculum
reform can reduce the potential motives for attack.
Strengthening education for peaceful resolution of conflicts,
respect for human rights and responsible citizenship in the
curriculum may also help reduce conflict and build peace.
In countries where attacks on education have taken place,
every year that passes without a school being rehabilitated
and reopened after an attack can mean a lost year of education
for its students. While conflict is ongoing, it is often too
dangerous to attempt to rebuild schools, but also when it ends,
governments frequently lack the funds or capacity to repair
and rehabilitate schools quickly, as has been the case in
Afghanistan and earlier in Sierra Leone, for instance. As a
result, it can take many years to overcome the impact of
attacks. Repair and rebuilding of education facilities may
therefore require sustained, large-scale collaboration with
international donors and NGOs to fill funding and capacity
gaps.

Protecting higher education

Protecting higher education can include some measures
similar to those used within primary and secondary schools,
such as using on-campus security guards or escorts and
strengthening gates, walls, fences and windows. But it can
also include other types of measures. Distance learning
programmes and scholarship schemes for studying, teaching
or researching abroad, for instance, have enabled education to
continue away from the source of threats. GCPEA’s recent
research examining the relationship between autonomy and
security concluded that enhancing university autonomy vis-àvis the state can also contribute to reducing the risk of attacks,
particularly where universities provide their own security
guards, by reducing the likelihood of confrontation between
students and the forces of the state and the likelihood of
arbitrary arrest over issues of academic freedom.

Advocacy
Reporting and advocacy by international human rights organizations, NGOs and UN agencies have increased awareness of
attacks and encouraged improved response and prevention.
Data from monitoring have been used to press military forces
to vacate schools that they have been using for military
purposes in Afghanistan, DRC and South Sudan, for example,
and to seek funds for repairing and resupplying damaged
schools. In some countries, such as India, organizations have
tried to persuade governments to stop using schools as voting
stations or teachers as polling officers during political
elections, which can heighten their vulnerability to attack.
Human rights organizations and trade union movements have
advocated internationally for the release of arbitrarily
detained, tortured or imprisoned students and academics in
countries such as Colombia, Iran, Sudan and Turkey.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Key recommendations
Attacking schools, universities, students, teachers and academics is a common tactic in situations of conflict
and insecurity around the world. While some progress has been made, much more can and should be done to
protect education:
• States should investigate, prosecute and, if guilt is proven, punish individuals responsible for ordering,
bearing command responsibility for, or taking part in, the range of violations of international law that
constitute attacks on education. Regional and international tribunals should, similarly, give specific
consideration to the range of violations that constitute attacks against education.
• Governments, the United Nations, regional peacekeepers and armed non-state groups should refrain from
using schools and universities for military purposes; they should endorse the Lucens Guidelines for
Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict and incorporate them into
their doctrine and policies.
• Government leaders and leaders of armed non-state groups should make clear public statements that
attacks on education are prohibited and issue clear military orders to this effect. States should also ensure
that their domestic law criminalizes all elements of attacks on education in line with international humanitarian and human rights law.
• Governments of states where attacks occur should rigorously monitor and investigate attacks against
students, teachers, academics and other education personnel, and schools and universities, as well as the
impact of such attacks, and use that information to coordinate responses. At the international level, the
human rights treaty monitoring bodies should more systematically raise the issue of attacks on education
and military use of schools in their examination of states, and governments and civil society should
provide more information about these violations in their submissions.
• Where safety concerns allow, UN agencies, NGOs, peace-keeping forces and governments should
undertake or support negotiations with parties to a conflict in order to reach agreement regarding respect
for schools as safe sanctuaries and re-opening closed schools.
• Governments should ensure education facilities, staff and students are not used for electoral tasks and
political events whenever it can be reasonably expected that such use would heighten the risk of attack.
• education ministries should adopt conflict-sensitive curricula and resourcing policies to ensure that
education does not help trigger conflict and become a target for attack.
• States should protect higher education institutions at all times and prevent violence and intimidation
against academics by introducing and implementing policies, regulations and laws that promote both
institutional autonomy and the security of higher education communities.

his study, undertaken under the auspices of GCPEA,
builds on the previous two Education under Attack
studies published by UNESCO in 2007 and 2010. For
the first time, it is published by a group of agencies
rather than a single agency. Since the last study, which
covered incidents up to mid-2009, there has been a huge
increase in reporting of attacks and, in turn, our
understanding of the problem and what should be done
about it has deepened and changed. This study aims to
make new information and analysis available, extensively
covering four years of attacks on education from January
2009 to December 2012, but also including information on
key incidents in the first nine months of 2013.5 Changes in
the amount of information available and the scope and
research resources of the study make it impossible to
determine whether there has been an increase in attacks
or, rather, more extensive monitoring or reporting of them.

MeTHODOLOGY

Definitions of terms for data
collection purposes
Types of attacks
This study focuses on violent attacks on education:
threats or deliberate use of force against students,
teachers, academics and any other education
personnel, as well as attacks on education buildings,
resources, materials and facilities, including
transport. These attacks may be carried out for
political, military, ideological, sectarian, ethnic or
religious reasons.
The common thread is that these incidents involve the
deliberate use of, or threat to use, force in ways that
disrupt, harm or deter the provision of education and
enjoyment of the right to education.
The study additionally reports on the use of schools
for military purposes or security operations by armed
forces, or police or other security forces, or by armed
non-state groups, including rebel forces or any other
armed military, ethnic, political, religious or sectarian
group. This is an issue of concern because the military
use of education buildings and facilities can turn them
into a target for attack and can displace students,
teachers, academics and other education personnel,
thereby serving to deny students access to education.
It also reports on some aspects of systematic denial of
the right to education by the state or armed non-state
groups, for instance, where a government punishes
student involvement in political protests by
preventing participants from continuing their studies
or where armed groups issue edicts ordering schools
to close or stay closed.
Some incidents that do not involve direct violence are
reported if they represent a denial of education
imposed by force. An illustrative example is the
unilateral imposition by the Israeli Defence Forces
(IDF) of a firing range within a few hundred metres of a
school in Janiba village in the West Bank in 2012
putting children at risk and the future of the school in
doubt; teachers were arrested on their way to classes
because they had entered the firing zone even though
the IDF had not informed them that the firing range
had been established near their school.6

34

The study does not count general collateral damage as
an attack on education, except regarding incidents in
the vicinity of education buildings and facilities where
the likely effect of intentional violence is harm to
students, education personnel or facilities. For
instance, if a bomb is detonated alongside a school
with the intention of harming a passing military patrol
and the school is damaged or students are killed, that
would be counted.
Moreover, the study does not include one-off, nonpolitically motivated violence by students or
individual adults, such as the killing of 20 children
and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary
School by a lone gunman in Newtown, Connecticut,
United States on 14 December 2012. Such incidents,
while devastating, are not addressed by this study
because they are not carried out by armed groups or
armed forces, or individuals associated with them, for
ideological, political, military, religious or sectarian
motives.
Targets of attack
Victims may include students, teachers, academics
and all other education personnel, including support
and transport staff (e.g. janitors, bus drivers, building
contractors); education officials (local and national);
education trade unionists; and education aid workers.
‘Personnel’ includes anyone working to support
education, paid or unpaid, short-term or long-term.
Other targets include education structures and
buildings (e.g. temporary learning spaces, schools,
colleges, universities, district education offices,
education ministry offices, temporary and permanent
examination halls, educational printers’ and
publishers’ offices, warehouses or printing works),
education resources, materials and facilities, and
transport and supply vehicles. Targets also include
education-related occasions or special events which
may or may not take place in a recognized education
building, such as graduation ceremonies;
school/university festivals or celebrations; education
conferences; or education protests, sit-ins and
demonstrations. These may have special symbolic
importance and put high numbers at risk.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Motives

Students

Although the study focuses on deliberate attacks
against students, education personnel and facilities,
the inclusion of incidents among the data presented
in the study is not dependent on establishing motive,
since this is difficult to prove in many cases through
simple data collection unless there are published or
publicly broadcasted orders or threats. Instead, data
collection has focused on the type of target and effect
or likely effect. However, motives have been included
in the analysis when they are sufficiently clear or could
be reasonably inferred from the data.

‘Student’ refers to anyone being taught or studying at
any level, from kindergarten to university, or in adult
learning, in both formal and non-formal programmes.

Perpetrators

Although all countries where known attacks have been
committed during the reporting period are included in
the study, only those countries in which a minimum
threshold of attacks has been documented are
analysed in depth in the Country profiles section of the
study. The threshold is an approximate measure,
referring to countries where at least five incidents have
taken place or five people have been harmed, and
where either at least one of those incidents is a direct
attack on a school or university or at least one student,
teacher or academic has been killed from 2009 to
2013.

The types of perpetrator covered by the study include
armed forces (including international armed forces),
police forces, intelligence services, paramilitaries and
militias acting on behalf of the state, and armed nonstate groups, including rebel forces or any other armed
military, ethnic, political, religious or sectarian group.
Perpetrators may also include violent mobs that are
not organized as an armed group but are animated by
similar motives. Although the study does not generally
include attacks of a criminal nature, it does look at the
phenomenon of attacks by armed organized criminal
groups, including drug cartels, and the impact of
related security operations in those situations where
violence is widespread and there is a pattern of
attacking education targets. These are included where
the criminal organizations operate on a scale comparable to some armed groups, using military grade
weapons, seeking to control or dominate areas of
territory, perhaps provoking a military response, or
extending their violence beyond pure criminality to
include political targets.
Schools
For the purposes of this study, ‘school’ is often used as
shorthand for a recognizable education facility or
place of learning. In other places, the short form
‘schools and universities’ is used to refer to the whole
gamut of early learning centres, schools, colleges and
universities.

Criteria for including country profiles
A significant number of attacks on education occur in
countries where there is conflict. But incidents,
notably those targeting higher education, also occur
in countries not affected by conflict, particularly those
where fundamental freedoms are restricted.
Therefore, the focus of the study is not restricted to
situations of armed conflict.

Criteria for categorizing intensity of attacks
Where the study uses aggregate figures for the period
2009-2012, including in the maps, it does so because
these are the years for which data have been collected
systematically, whereas for 2013 only data for key
incidents up to September have been collected.
Use of education data
The statistical information on enrolment and literacy
rates in profiled countries should be treated with
caution, especially in the case of those countries that
have experienced considerable disruption due to
armed conflict, insecurity or instability. Though
formally correct, such statistical data may contain
outdated information and may not capture with full
accuracy the actual educational situation of a country
or of a particular area where attacks are occurring
within a country.

Methods of data collection and analysis
The research team undertook a comprehensive review
of the literature in English and conducted research
into and analysis of information made available by UN
agencies, human rights and development organizations, government bodies, scholar rescue
organizations and trade unions as well in media
reports, using standard sets of research terms. To
research specific incidents, online searches were
carried out using a detailed list of combinations of
search terms for each country. The terms included the
name of the country or geographic area, year, type of
victim or target, and type or method of attack. The
resulting information was then screened for reliability
and compatibility with the study’s definitions and
terms of reference. For media and human rights
sources, reliability was assessed using a range of
criteria, including in the case of media reports,
whether a professional news agency was used,
whether the language was objective, whether professional standards of good-quality journalism had been
observed and whether there appeared to be any
political bias. Where there was uncertainty about the
quality or independence of the source, advice on its
reliability was sought from in-country researchers and
development and human rights experts.
Tailored online research was carried out in four
languages: English, French, Spanish and, to a limited
extent, Arabic. In addition, a detailed questionnaire
on incidents in 2009-2012 was sent to selected field
offices of some GCPEA member agencies to
complement information culled during the extensive
review of government, UN, NGO and media reports
covering 2009-2012. More limited research was
carried out into incidents in the first nine months of
2013.
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with
members of human rights and development organizations and relevant trade unions in affected countries,
as well as those monitoring particular countries.
Focused follow-up investigations were carried out by
researchers based in a small number of affected
countries, including Colombia, Egypt, Mexico,
Thailand, Yemen and Zimbabwe.

Where numbers of attacks are cited in the study, they
are drawn either from a particular reliable source such
as the UN, in which case the source is cited, or they are
a tally of reported individual incidents compiled from
other secondary sources, including media reports and
reports by human rights organizations of individual
attacks, each of which is cited.
A summary of incidents for each country was prepared
and a tally produced for broad categories of incident,
target or victim. From this information, and in some
cases from complementary interviews, data were
triangulated, where possible, to avoid double
counting of incidents. A chronological list of reported
incidents for each country was created, along with
citations. All reports of incidents concerning the same
named victim, or same named target in the same
location within several days, were compared to
remove duplication and ensure reliable reporting.
Where figures for the same incident differed, the more
conservative count was used.
The study was extensively reviewed by experts in
human rights, international law, education-inemergencies and research methodology.

Challenges and limitations of data
collection and analysis
Monitoring and reporting of attacks on education are
improving but, without a global system for systematically gathering data, all figures on attacks should be
treated with caution. The figures in this study are
compiled from a wide range of sources of varying
quality – from UN monitoring to human rights and
media reports – each of which has its own limitations.
For example, data in the UN Secretary-General’s
reports on children and armed conflict include only
those incidents that the UN has been able to verify,
which are typically a small sub-set of the number of
violations actually taking place.7 The researchers for
Education under Attack have striven to present a
minimum count of the number of attacks. However, in
many places, attacks simply are not being reported
consistently or even at all; in others, the dearth of
official information necessitates a heavy reliance on
media and human rights sources. From those sources,

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

we used only those that we judged to be reliable. The
research team, however, did not seek to verify each
case presented in this study. What the figures
presented in this study do indicate – with all their
limitations – is that the problem is serious and
widespread.
Among organizations collecting information on
attacks on education there is no commonly agreed
data set that would enable accurate analysis of trends
across countries. The lack of reliable baselines from
which to monitor trends over time, even within the
same country, makes it difficult to know with certainty
whether attacks in general, and specific types of
attack in particular, have increased or decreased over
time or have changed in nature or geographic distribution or whether observed changes are more likely to
be attributable to increases, decreases or inconsistencies in reporting.
The nature of the situations in which many attacks on
education occur – where armed conflicts are ongoing
or security constraints limit the availability of information – places heavy restrictions on how many
incidents can be verified or even reported. In many
locations, victims are afraid to report to international
NGOs on education-related or other types of incident
because they are scared of retribution if they are
identified. For instance, in Gaza, many human rights
groups are reluctant to report on child recruitment by
Palestinian armed groups for fear of reprisals.8 In
many parts of Afghanistan, it is too dangerous for
community elders to visit the offices of NGOs to
provide information lest they be tracked back to their
villages by anti-government groups. And the local staff
of those NGOs may themselves be reluctant to report
what information they do receive for fear of reprisals.
For these reasons, the picture presented by the study
is inevitably incomplete.
In some locations, there is limited access to mobile
phone networks, telephone landlines, faxes or email
to report information, along with a lack of information
management systems in which to store it and compare
sources. For example, the Nigerian military banned
the use of satellite phones in north-east Nigeria
because, they claimed, the group Boko Haram had
used satellite phones to plan attacks on schools.9

Rigorous collection and verification of data are
similarly complicated in some contexts where governments tightly control the flow of information and may
themselves be perpetrators of attacks. Often, in these
situations, there are very few sources of information
and the few organizations that may be monitoring
attacks may sympathize with the opposition group
being targeted by the government and therefore may
be biased in their reporting. Even where governments
are not responsible for committing attacks and may be
taking measures to prevent them, there may be
political sensitivities that make them reluctant to
publicly share data about attacks.
For some types of attack, there appear to be
systematic gaps in information. For example, data
collected on child recruitment and sexual violence do
not always specify the location in which these violations occur; consequently, it is more difficult, in many
cases, to determine whether there may be a pattern of
these kinds of incidents occurring in schools or along
school routes. In cases where teachers, academics or
other personnel are killed, wounded or arrested, information is often missing that would help to distinguish
whether or not they were targeted because of their
professional status or the exercise of their profession,
or for unrelated reasons that fall outside the scope of
this study. The same is true of students, particularly in
higher education. When figures are provided for the
number of schools damaged or destroyed, typically
there is no information on how many of these were
targeted and how many were incidents of collateral
damage. In this study, it is specified when it is
unknown whether attacks are targeted and those
incidents are not counted in any aggregate figures of
attacks. As a result, the aggregate figures are likely to
be undercounts.
The difficulty of cross-checking incidents across
different sources, with the exception of major
incidents that have drawn considerable national or
international attention, is also a limitation of the
study’s data collection and analysis. Even where
electronic information management systems are
being used to assist verification and are able to draw
on data from a number of systems, as they are in
Palestine, it may not be possible to match up data

37

MeTHODOLOGY

from different sources unless the same unique
identities are assigned to the same schools where
attacks have occurred or the same spelling is used.
To date, rigorous research – whether quantitative or
qualitative – into the impact of attacks, particularly
the long-term impact, is lacking. So, too, are in-depth
evaluations studying the outcomes of measures taken
by governments, NGOs and communities aimed at
preventing or responding to attacks. As a result, for
the sections on the impact of attacks and responses to
attacks, the study has had to rely primarily on case
study evidence and reports of measures undertaken
and challenges faced.
Finally, due to time and resource constraints, fieldbased country research, particularly into the impacts
of attacks and the outcomes of prevention and
response measures at local and national levels, was
extremely limited. For this study, it was not possible to
undertake in-depth discussions with students,
teachers and other education personnel, and the
families and communities of which they are a part.
Consequently, these important voices are often
missing from the analysis. However, interviews with
country-level informants, including ministry staff in a
small number of cases, human rights researchers, and
NGO and UN programme staff, as well as data
provided in response to requests for information and a
thorough review of existing literature, have helped to
provide a more complete picture.

Scale and nature of attacks on education

T

housands of targeted attacks on education have been reported
across dozens of countries and spanning most regions of the world
in the period covered by this study, 2009-2013.

The vast majority of these attacks involved either the bombing, shelling
or burning of schools or universities, or the killing, injury, kidnapping,
abduction or arbitrary arrest of students, teachers and academics. Some
were carried out by armed forces or security forces, others by armed
non-state groups or in some cases by armed criminal groups.
In addition, education facilities were used as bases, barracks or
detention centres by armed groups and armed forces. Moreover, there
was significant evidence of children being recruited for use as
combatants from schools and some instances of sexual violence by
military forces and armed groups against students and teachers.

41

PART I — GLOBAL OveRvIeW

This study reports on incidents in 30 countries
in which a significant pattern of attacks on
education has been found. These are
Afghanistan, Bahrain, Central African Republic
(CAR), Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), egypt, ethiopia,
India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel/Palestine,
Kenya, Libya, Mali, Mexico, Myanmar, Nigeria,
Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, Somalia,
South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Turkey,
Yemen and Zimbabwe.
The 30 countries profiled all have five or more
incidents or victims including at least one direct
attack on a school or the killing of at least one
teacher, student or academic. There are other
countries in which evidence of isolated or sporadic
attacks on education have been found. For instance,
attacks on higher education have also been reported
in Angola, Bangladesh, Belarus, Brazil, Cambodia,
China,10 Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Ireland,
Kyrgyzstan, Malawi,11 Maldives, Malaysia, Rwanda,
Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sri Lanka,12 Swaziland,13
Tunisia, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates (UAE),
Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Venezuela and
Vietnam by the Scholars at Risk Network,14 and in
Dominican Republic,15 Haiti,16 Sri Lanka,17 Sweden18
and Togo19 by media sources. Countries where
isolated or sporadic attacks on primary and
secondary education were reported include Algeria,20
Chad,21 Chile,22 China,23 France,24 Georgia,25
Guatemala,26 Kyrgyzstan,27 Liberia,28 Nepal,29 Papua
New Guinea,30 Tunisia31 and the United Kingdom
(UK).32
The very heavily affected countries — where reports
documented 1,000 or more attacks on schools, universities, staff and students or 1,000 or more students,
teachers or other education personnel attacked or
education buildings attacked or used for military
purposes in 2009-2012 — were Afghanistan,
Colombia, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan and Syria.
In Afghanistan, according to the UN, there were 1,110
or more attacks on school-level education, including

arson attacks, explosions and suicide bombings. Staff
were threatened, killed and kidnapped.33
In Pakistan, armed groups, particularly the Pakistani
Taliban, attacked at least 838 schools, mostly by
blowing up school buildings, according to primary
research by the independent Human Rights
Commission of Pakistan.34 In the vast majority of
cases, school buildings were blown up at night using
explosives detonated remotely or by timers. Others
were shelled or subjected to grenade or armed
attacks. Few of the perpetrators were arrested or

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

prosecuted yet hundreds of schools were destroyed,
depriving hundreds of thousands of children of an
education.35 A compilation of human rights and media
reports suggests that at least 30 schoolchildren were
killed and 102 injured in attacks at or en route to
school in Pakistan from 2009 to 2012, and at least 138
school students and staff were reported to have been
kidnapped.36
Colombia was one the most dangerous places in the
world to be a teacher, with the highest reported
number of teachers killed or receiving death threats:

some 140 teachers were killed from 2009 to 2012,
1,086 received death threats and 305 were forced to
leave their homes because their lives were at risk,
according to the Escuela Nacional Sindical (ENS), a
prominent Colombian NGO monitoring labour rights.37
In Sudan, there were sustained attacks on higher
education: at least 15 university students were
reported killed, at least 479 injured and more than
1,040 arrested or detained during 2009-2012. Most of
these violations occurred during student demonstrations at universities, though a number of those

43

PART I — GLOBAL OveRvIeW

students injured or arrested were involved in protests
on wider political issues.38 In one incident, some 450
student rooms at Omdurman Islamic University in
Khartoum were set on fire by security agents and
supporters of the National Congress Party.39 Some
students were reported to have been abducted by
security agents and tortured.40

containing the Ministry of Education and other
ministries killed more than 100 people, many of whom
were students and their parents. They were gathering
to obtain examination results needed for scholarships
to study abroad. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. In
a pre-recorded interview, their suicide bomber
reportedly condemned the education system and criticized students for wanting to study abroad.49 Another
suicide bombing at Benadir University’s graduation
ceremony in Mogadishu in 2009 killed 22 people,
including the ministers of education, higher education
and health, the dean of the medical school, professors
and students.50

In some countries, there were more than a thousand
schools destroyed but it was not clear how many were
targeted deliberately. During the civil conflict in Syria,
by September 2012, more than 2,000 schools had
been damaged or destroyed, according to UNICEF, and
by April 2013 that figure had risen to 2,445.41 Both
sides used schools either as military headquarters,
military bases or detention centres,42 and the Syrian
Network for Human Rights alleged that the
government had turned a thousand schools into
detention and torture centres.43 Human Rights Watch
presented evidence that schools had been deliberately targeted, in one case causing the death of 12
students.44 During Libya’s civil war in 2011, some
1,900 schools were damaged or destroyed. It is not
known how many were deliberately targeted, but at
least 221 were reportedly used by armed groups,
making them a potential target, and 27 deliberate
attacks on schools were documented, a figure which
the UN said reflected only a portion of all the incidents
that took place.45

Death threats and the threat of kidnap were mostly
directed at individuals but some were also directed at
large groups of students or teachers. In Mexico, for
instance, armed criminal groups threatened teachers
with kidnapping or other violence if they did not hand
over a portion of their salaries.51 In some cases,
individuals or individual schools were targeted52
while, in another, the entire teaching staff of a specific
education district was threatened.53

Other heavily affected countries — where there were
between 500 and 999 attacks, victims or affected
facilities — include: Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Iraq,
Israel/Palestine, Libya, Mexico and Yemen. For
instance, in Yemen, there were more than 720
incidents involving the use of force affecting schools,
school teachers and school students, although not all
of them were targeted attacks.46 These incidents
included looting, shelling, bombardment, military use
by armed forces or armed groups, arson and threats to
personnel.47 In Côte d’Ivoire, armed groups and
military forces destroyed, damaged, looted or used
480 schools and universities during 2010-2011 and 50
university students were attacked.48

In Afghanistan, for instance, the total number of
reported attacks on education fell dramatically after
2009.55 According to one piece of research, an
apparent change in the Taliban’s policy on attacking
schools was believed to have resulted from the
Taliban’s gradual transformation into a militarypolitical insurgency, its concern to respond to
community pressure regarding schools, and an
apparent increasing willingness on the government’s
part to negotiate with the Taliban and agree concessions on education.56 However, evidence that attacks
on schools increased in 2012 and spread to new areas
threw into question the reality of that supposed policy
change.57

Some of the most devastating and high-profile
incidents occurred in Somalia, where, for example, in
October 2011, a suicide attack at a compound

Some countries that were previously heavily affected,
such as Nepal,58 are no longer experiencing a pattern
of attacks on education. In Nepal’s case, the number

Since the first global study54 on attacks on education
was published in 2007, increases or decreases in the
reported number of attacks in individual countries
have been observed, often because of changes in the
conflicts or in the political situations in which they
occur.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

of incidents decreased very significantly when the
Maoist insurgency ended in 2006 and, although
attacks flared up in the Terai region after that, they
petered out at the start of 2009.59
By contrast, in many Middle Eastern and North African
countries, there was a sharp rise in attacks and in the
military use of schools as Arab Spring protests and
uprisings took hold from December 2010 onwards.
In collecting and analysing data from the period 20092012, this study has found a significantly greater
number of countries in which there is evidence of very
high or high levels of attack on education compared
with the periods covered by the previous two

2007. It is difficult to know whether this represents an
actual increase in incidence or whether increased
attention to this issue among media, human rights
groups, and humanitarian and development organizations since the publication of the last two studies,
combined with improved access to local media
sources via the internet, has simply resulted in the
availability of more and better information.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Reported motives and perpetrators of attacks
The reported motives for attacks on schools, students
and teachers include, in no particular order, to:
• destroy symbols of government control or
demonstrate control over an area by the antigovernment element;
• seize school or university buildings for use as
barracks, bases or firing positions, or attack
them because they are being used for these
purposes by opposing forces;
• block the education of girls;
• block education that is perceived to impose
alien religious or cultural values;
• react against curricula that are perceived to
meet the preferences of the elite or the majority
group, or that portray certain identity groups in
an inferior or hostile way;
• prevent schools from teaching a language,
religion, culture or history alien to the particular
identity group;
• restrict teacher trade union activity and
academic freedom;
• threaten a particular ethnic group;
• abduct children for use as combatants, sex slaves
or logistical support for military operations; or
• raise money by extortion or ransom.
The reported motives vary according to each context,
but also may vary within each situation and there may
be multiple motives for any single attack. For instance,
in southern Thailand, the motive of ethnic Malay
Muslim insurgent groups in attacking schools may
stem from their perception that schools are being or
have been used as a means to impose Buddhism, Thai
language and Thai versions of history on ethnic Malay
Muslims, but it may also be a means of challenging
government control of the area.60
Depending on the context, attacks may be carried out
by any number of the following groups: armed forces
(including international armed forces), police forces,
intelligence services, paramilitaries and militias
acting on behalf of the state, and armed non-state
groups including rebel forces and any other armed

military, ethnic, political, religious or sectarian group;
or in some cases by armed criminal groups. Attacks
may also be carried out by violent mobs that are not
organized as an armed group.
In reviewing available evidence, it appears that certain
types of attacks are more likely to be carried out by
government or government-backed forces,61 such as
arrests, imprisonment, torture and attacks on higher
education. These government-instigated attacks are
typically linked to motives such as restricting trade
union activity, quelling dissent and controlling information, or marginalizing a particular ethnic or political
group. Other types of attack may sometimes be
performed by government forces but are more likely to
be carried out by armed groups including progovernment paramilitaries and militia or
anti-government forces, such as abduction of
students and teachers and attacks on government
schools. They are often linked to motives that may
include spreading fear among civilians. When perpetrated by anti-government groups the motives may
include undermining government control over an area
or community, preventing the education of certain
groups such as girls, or reacting against perceived
bias in curricula and teaching that may reflect wider
social, religious or ethnic discrimination or conflict.
In some cases, there is a blurring of the line between
armed groups and armed criminal groups, and
between military and criminal motives. In some
countries, such as the Philippines,62 armed groups
have kidnapped teachers as a means to secure
ransom money to fund their activities. In Mexico,
killings, kidnappings and threats, particularly against
teachers, have reportedly been carried out by armed
criminal gangs.63 In Colombia, criminal groups have
attacked schools in similar ways to armed groups,
seeking to control territory and using schools as
recruitment grounds. In Medellín, for instance,
criminal groups, linked to paramilitary successor
groups,64 have threatened or killed students en route
to or from school.65
The study has found a wide range of motives ascribed
to the various attacks on education, but it is difficult to
draw any firm conclusions because it is hard to find
solid evidence for the motive behind many individual
incidents.

Military use of schools and universities
Military use of school and university facilities was reported
in at least 24 of the 30 countries profiled during the 20092013 period: Afghanistan, CAR, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire,
DRC, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iraq, Indonesia,
Israel/Palestine, Kenya, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Pakistan, the
Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Thailand,
Yemen and Zimbabwe.
Education buildings were used as barracks to house
soldiers/fighters, bases to mount security operations,
fighting positions, prisons or detention centres, interrogation centres, torture centres, training grounds for soldiers
and places to store weapons. Schools were also used to
indoctrinate, recruit and train students.
The forces using the schools included armed groups,
paramilitaries, armed forces, police forces and international
forces – the UN recorded five incidents of school occupation
by international military forces in Afghanistan in 2010, for
instance.66
The country with by far the most reported incidents in 20092012 was Syria where military use arising from the conflict
spiked in 2011-2012. Although it does not specify exact
figures, the UN reported numerous incidents of government
forces using schools as temporary bases or detention
centres and there were allegations that the Free Syrian Army
used schools in a number of areas as bases and as places to
store ammunition during this period. Furthermore, the
Syrian Network for Human Rights alleged in mid-January
2013 that government forces had used approximately 1,000
schools as detention and torture centres and used schools
to house security and intelligence personnel or as positions
from which to shell the surrounding area. Across the 14 other
countries with the highest incidence of military use in 20092012 – Afghanistan, CAR, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, DRC,
India, Libya, Mali, Pakistan, the Philippines, Somalia, South
Sudan, Thailand and Yemen – a total of 923 schools and
universities were reported as being used for military
purposes.67 In Libya, 221 schools were used by armed
groups during the 2011 uprising,according to a UN
respondent,68 and at least one school was used to detain
hundreds of prisoners.69 In India in 2010, more than 129

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

schools were used as barracks or bases in operations, particularly in states most affected by the
Maoist insurgency.70 Police and paramilitary forces
occupied school buildings, either temporarily or for
extended periods ranging from six months to three
years during their counter-insurgency operations.
Some were occupied for over a decade.71 In Thailand,
security forces occupied at least 79 schools in 201072
and continued to use schools as barracks and bases
for at least the next year, Human Rights Watch
reported.73
Colombia and the Philippines specifically prohibit the
military use of schools in military policy,74 and
national legislation bans the practice unequivocally
in the Philippines.75 Yet in Colombia, the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) recorded 75 cases
of occupation of school facilities by all armed actors
during 2009-2012;76 and in the Philippines, the
military was responsible for most of the 56 incidents
of military use of schools in 2010-2012 recorded by
the UN. They used some schools as barracks or bases
for over a year;77 used functioning schools as
weapons and ammunition stores in 2010;78 and, in
2011, used at least 14 schools during the course of
counter-insurgency operations.79
In many countries, the military use of schools led to
them being attacked or was employed as a justification by perpetrators of attacks. In Somalia, for
instance, Al-Shabaab fighters used a school in
Mogadishu as a firing position while the students
were still in the classrooms, drawing return fire from
pro-government forces. Five rockets hit the school
compound, with one striking and killing eight people
just as the students were leaving the school.80
In some places, such as India, rebels claimed they
were attacking schools because they were or had
been occupied by security forces even though this
was not always the case.81 When using schools,
police often fortified the buildings, set up sentry
boxes and lookout shelters and dug trenches or
created barriers from rings of barbed wire and
sandbags, leaving schools resembling military installations rather than neutral places of learning. This
may have increased the risk that they might be viewed
as military targets even after the troops had left.82

Recruitment of children and sexual
violence at schools or along school routes
Recruitment of children for military purposes and
sexual violence are addressed in this study only
insofar as they amount to a type of attack on schools
and students. While forced recruitment and sexual
violence happen in a range of settings during conflict,
parties may specifically target schools or school
routes because they are places where children are
known to be concentrated. Although child recruitment
and sexual violence are regularly reported by the UN,
there is very little reporting on how many of these
violations take place at school or along school routes.
This study found evidence of recruitment of children
from school, or en route to or from school, during the
2009-2012 period in at least six countries: Colombia,
DRC, Pakistan, Somalia, Thailand and Yemen. In
Colombia, guerrilla and paramilitary groups were
reported to recruit children at schools;83 child recruits
were used as spies or to transport arms or pass on
messages to other students in schools, as well as to
run their drug business inside schools.84 In Pakistan,
children were recruited from madrassas (religious
schools) and mainstream schools. In some cases,
they were lured or abducted from schools and
madrassas to train to become suicide bombers.85
Recruitment methods varied across countries and
ranged from selection through indoctrination
programmes at school and the offering of inducements, to abduction en route, the use of death threats
and the rounding up of whole groups of students at
schools.
For example, in Colombia, armed groups waited
outside schools to talk to children, find out information, and recruit and control them.86 In Yemen,
Houthi rebels used students and teachers to recruit
children at schools for them.87 In DRC, a breakaway
rebel group seized 32 boys from a school, tied them up
and marched them off to a military camp to train to
fight.88
In Somalia, where thousands of children were given
military training or recruited, mostly from schools,
teachers were ordered by the armed group Al-Shabaab
to enlist them or release them for training.89 One

54

witness told Human Rights Watch how students
scrambled to jump out of school windows on the
second and third storeys to escape Al-Shabaab
members when they came to their school.90
Isolated cases of sexual violence against students and
teachers perpetrated by armed forces or armed groups
at, or en route to or from, schools or universities were
also reported in DRC and Somalia. Two incidents in
CAR and India were also reported in 2012-2013.
Human Rights Watch research in Somalia found
evidence of girls being lined up at schools and taken
to be ‘wives’ of Al-Shabaab fighters. In one case, the
girls were selected at gunpoint; one who refused to be
taken was shot dead in front of her classmates.91 In
another incident, after 12 girls were taken by AlShabaab, the teacher reported that some 150 female
students dropped out of school. One of the 12 taken, a
16-year-old, was beheaded after refusing to marry a
fighter much older than her and her head was brought
back to be shown to the remaining girls at the school
as a warning.92
The number of incidents is likely to be under-reported,
especially for incidents en route to or from school.

Attacks on higher education
The study found attacks on higher education facilities,
students and academics and military use of universities were reported in 28 of the 30 profiled countries
in 2009-2012. The exceptions were CAR and Mali.
Attacks on higher education over the reporting period
included assassination, killing or injury of students
and academics, arbitrary arrest, torture, abduction,
kidnapping, imprisonment and the bombing of groups
of students, individual academics and higher
education facilities. There were also incidents of
universities being taken over or shut down by force.
These attacks on higher education were carried out
both by government armed forces, security forces or
police and by armed non-state groups, including
guerrillas, rebels, paramilitaries and militias. The
difference from school-level attacks is that, in higher
education, a greater proportion of attacks involve
arbitrary arrest or forms of persecution of named
individuals and there are far fewer attacks on

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

buildings. In this regard, they are closer in type to
attacks on teacher trade unionists.
The countries with the highest number of reported
attacks on higher education included Sudan and
Yemen. The largest number of university students
killed was reported in Yemen, where 73 higher
education students were killed during the 2011
uprising and 139 were injured, 38 of whom were
permanently disabled as a result of their injury,
according to the Wafa Organization for Martyrs’
Families and Wounded Care.93 However, it is not
known how many of these killings and injuries
occurred on campus or in the vicinity of universities, or
because the victims were being targeted as students.
By contrast in Sudan, far fewer university students
were reportedly killed (15), but far more were injured
(479), many when police and security forces used
excessive force against students demonstrating on
campus over university policies.94
The largest number of university student arrests was
reported in Sudan – with more than a thousand

arrested, mostly in incidents directly related to
protests on education issues or carried out at
university dormitories or other education facilities.95
Where killings took place, in many cases they were
related to excessive use of force by security forces
against student demonstrators or were targeted
killings of individual academics and students. Some
of the most serious incidents involved raids carried
out on student dormitories or other forms of campus
residence in Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Sudan and Syria.96 For instance, in
September 2013, gunmen stormed a dormitory in the
middle of the night at a college in Yobe, Nigeria, and
opened fire, killing at least 50 students;97 and security
forces killed seven students, injured 49 and arrested

330 in two raids on dormitories at Damascus and
Aleppo universities in Syria in 2011 and 2012.98
Cases of abduction and torture were also reported in
some countries. In Sudan, a Darfuri student at the
University of Khartoum’s Department of Education
was reportedly seized by National Intelligence and
Security Service agents in front of the university on 10
February 2010. His body was found the next day in a
street in Khartoum and showed signs of torture.99
Attacks on higher education facilities – damaging,
destroying or threatening university buildings and
campuses – occurred in 17 countries: Afghanistan,
Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel/Palestine,
Libya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines,
Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In
Nigeria, at least 15 universities were reported to have
received an email message in September 2011,
apparently from the violent Jihadist movement Boko
Haram, warning them that their campuses were on a
target list for bombings.100 In Mexico, bombs were
sent to six university campuses or research institutes,
in some cases causing injury, and six more were listed
as targets, reportedly by a group opposing nanotechnology research.101
Military use of higher education facilities
Military use of higher education facilities appears to
be less pervasive than military use of school facilities,
but has been a problem in several countries,
including Côte d’Ivoire,102 Somalia103 and Yemen; in
the latter, the breakaway First Armoured Division
forces occupied Sana’a University Old Campus in
2011, halting university life for 10 months.104 In
Somalia, university campuses were used by the
armed group Al-Shabaab, as well as by African Union
forces in the international peacekeeping force,
AMISOM, and government troops, particularly during
2012 military campaigns that drove Al-Shabaab out of
their strongholds.105
Motives and targets
The motives for attacks on higher education also
varied from one context to another, but were often
quite different from those for attacks on school-level
education and bore a closer resemblance to those for
attacks on teacher trade unionists. Many attacks on

57

PART I — GLOBAL OveRvIeW

higher education were connected to a government’s
desire to prevent the growth of opposition
movements, restrict political debate or criticism of
policies, and prevent alternative points of view from
being expressed or gaining support. Others related to
government authorities’ wish to restrict education
trade union activity, silence student protests, prevent
certain subjects being researched by academics
(ranging from human rights issues to concerns about
HIV/AIDS) or limit the influence of, or exposure to,
foreign ideas.
As with attacks on schools, students and teachers,
there were also cases of sectarian attacks and ethnic
groups being targeted. In Sudan, for example,
unknown men attacked 15 Darfuri students in their
dormitory at Khartoum University in 2009.106 In
Ethiopia, in June 2012, security forces reportedly
stormed dormitories and arrested engineering
students at Haromaya University in Oromia to break up
a demonstration and held them outside without food
for two days.107
In addition, attacks on higher education were carried
out as a show of strength or in retaliation for military
gains unrelated to education. The Taliban said they
launched a double suicide bombing on the
International Islamic University in Islamabad on 20
October 2009, which killed two female and three male
students, in retaliation for a Pakistani army offensive
in South Waziristan.108 During Operation Cast Lead in
Gaza at the turn of 2008-2009 (27 December-18
January), Israeli forces damaged 14 of the 15 higher
education institutions in the Gaza Strip, destroying
three colleges and six university buildings.109 The
action appeared to be part of a strategy of destroying
enemy infrastructure, as reportedly declared by the
Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff.110

Long-term impact of attacks on education
There is a dearth of research quantifying the long-term
impact on education of the types of attack
documented in this study. In some countries,
education authorities or international NGOs have
documented the immediate impact, such as the
number of schools damaged or destroyed, or the
number of teachers or students killed or injured, but

58

information on how the provision of education is
affected, let alone the wider social and economic
impact, is scant. However, a wide range of potential
effects can be hypothesized from individual effects
documented in media and human rights reports and
research into attacks on education.
Where attacks on education are persistent in an area
or the threat of force is used to block recovery from
attacks, the impact may well include any number of
the following effects which impinge on student
attainment and access to good-quality education:
• chronic disruption of attendance by students,
teachers and other education staff;
• permanent drop-out of students, teachers and
other education staff;
• falling recruitment of staff, leading to teacher
shortages, and declining enrolment of
students, hindering attempts to achieve
Education for All;111
• persistent demotivation and distraction of
students, teachers and other education staff by
fear or trauma and other factors that lower the
quality of teaching and impinge on students’
ability to learn;
• damage to or failure to repair or resupply infrastructure, textbooks and other learning
materials that reduces access, reduces the
quality of teaching and learning, and potentially puts students, teachers and other
education staff at risk;
• reduced government capacity to deliver
education or develop the education system;
• suspension or reduction in international aid for
education;
• falling recruitment of teacher trade unionists,
reducing their capacity to provide a teachers’
viewpoint on the development of education.112
Across countries where attacks are persistent, UN,
media and human rights reports indicate that
hundreds of thousands of children have been denied
access to education, in some cases for years, because
of the length of time schools are closed: either the reopening or rebuilding of schools is blocked by the

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

security threat or the government does not have the
capacity or the will to rebuild in a timely way. For
instance, in Yemen, 54 schools were closed for up to
two months after 143 attacks on education in 2011,
affecting 182,000 children. In Afghanistan, the
Ministry of Education reported that more than 590
schools were closed in vulnerable areas as of May
2012, compared to 800 or more in 2009.114 In some
cases, security threats or prolonged military use block
them being rebuilt or reopened, as in India where by

2009 police had occupied some schools for three
years and one for a decade,115 and in South Sudan,
where armed forces occupied some schools for up to
five years.116

A particularly stark example of this problem was found
in Sierra Leone, prior to this study’s reporting period,
where pupils and teachers were abducted from
schools and where schools and symbols of education
were widely targeted for destruction: by the time the
decade-long conflict ended in 2002, 87 per cent of
schools were unusable due in part to damage caused
by attacks. Three years later, 60 per cent of primary
schools and 40 per cent of secondary schools still

60

required major rehabilitation or reconstruction. It is
not known for how many years during the conflict
those particular schools were out of use but the
figures suggest that entire cohorts of children in many
areas missed out on between three and 13 years of
schooling.117
In those schools that do continue to operate after
attacks or threats of attack, the quality of the
education provided and the quality of the learning
experienced may be greatly reduced. A commonly
reported problem is teachers fleeing the area or giving
up their jobs. Similarly, students may be withdrawn
from school or not sent back to school because of
parental fears for their safety. Attacks on schools and
recruitment from schools may also be a reason for

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

families or communities uprooting and seeking a
place of safety.
Destruction of infrastructure may lead to overcrowding
in remaining classrooms and may put children at risk
in unsafe learning environments if damage has not
been repaired or schools and school grounds not
cleared of unexploded ordnance and other dangerous
objects. Some schools may be forced to organize
double shifts to accommodate students from other
schools that have been damaged, reducing the
number of classroom hours and subjecting facilities to
additional wear-and-tear. Looting and damage of
classroom materials may leave students without
textbooks and other items that facilitate learning,
further affecting the quality of education.
Where schools are damaged the quality of education
provided will be lowered, and that impact will last for
all the time that the schools are not repaired. For
example, in Gaza, according to the Ministry of
Education, none of the 280 schools damaged
(including 18 completely destroyed) in the Israeli
military incursion that ended in January 2009 had
been repaired by February 2010 because an Israeli
blockade prevented construction materials from
entering the territory.118 The effects of the damage
therefore continued for at least one year after the
damage occurred.
In addition, students and staff may experience
prolonged psychological distress, ranging from
distraction to trauma, that impairs their ability to study
or teach to their full potential, as is the case with
students who witness other acts of violence in conflict.
A 2009 field study in Yemen found that 54 per cent of
1,100 children surveyed had had nightmares after
witnessing conflict in their schools or villages, 35 per
cent had been aggressive towards their relatives or
peers, 22 per cent had considered dropping out of
school and 22 per cent were prone to bed-wetting or
unconscious urination.119
Military use of schools not only makes them a target
for attack, but leads to degradation of facilities and
furniture. Where classes are ongoing, students and
teachers are put at risk from attacks or crossfire or the
presence of weapons and are vulnerable to
misconduct by troops and security forces, including

sexual advances. In many cases, parents withdraw
their children from school – and girls are typically the
first to be kept at home. Where they do not, dual use of
the facilities can lead to overcrowding and a lowered
quality of education provided, particularly where
military use lasts for long periods120 – for example,
some schools were occupied for three years in India.121
Repeated attacks, and the associated security threat,
can challenge the capacity of the state to manage or
provide education services – ranging from paying
teachers and rebuilding or re-supplying education
facilities to holding examinations and inspecting
schools. Recurrent attacks undermine or halt social
and economic development, for which education is a
key enabling provision, and can threaten the stability
of particular villages, regions or even whole states,
undermining government control of the country. This
may be a key reason why schools are systematically
attacked in some countries.122 The destruction of
schools in Pakistan was seen as a powerful symbol of
the Pakistani Taliban insurgents’ ability to operate in
the border areas with impunity, thereby undermining
people’s sense of the government’s ability to assure
their safety. A Pakistani Taliban campaign of assassination of anyone seen to be helping rebuild schools
hampered the recovery effort.123
Due to the interdependence and interconnectedness
of the various components of an education system,
attacks on higher education communities and institutions have an impact on all levels of education and
society. As with attacks at other levels of education,
they put students’ and academics’ lives and liberty at
grave risk, as well as those of their families, and may
also cause falling enrolment, withdrawal from
education and flight of teaching staff. The effects of
attacks can be devastating for research and teaching
because they trigger retreat, fear and flight and may
silence a whole academic community. Attacks on
higher education can also limit the subjects that can
be studied or researched, restrict international collaboration and undermine the university as a learning
institution. They have wider consequences for society,
too, in restricting development, particularly the
emergence or strengthening of political plurality,
accountable government and open democracy.

Response and prevention
So what can be done to stop attacks on education and
how can their impact be limited? There are many ways
in which the problem is already being addressed. An
important first step is to gather more information
about the nature, scale and location of the threat
through monitoring, assessment and reporting. There
are ways to deter attacks by holding perpetrators to
account and to reduce military use through laws and
policies that prohibit the practice. Numerous ways of
improving security for schools have been attempted.
Negotiations have been held with armed groups and
government forces to treat schools as zones of peace,
free of military activity. Education ministries and
authorities can address grievances that otherwise
may increase the risk of attack by developing and
implementing conflict-sensitive policies and curricula.
However, while more information has been gathered
on prevention and response since the last Education
under Attack study was published in 2010, rigorous,
empirical and comparative research into the effectiveness of different measures is still lacking, in part
due to the major methodological challenges of
conducting such research.124 The appropriateness of
the response used depends heavily on the nature of
the attacks and their perpetrators, as well as the
overall conflict and community dynamics in a given
situation. A clear understanding is still needed of
exactly how these factors influence the success or
failure of a particular intervention in different
contexts; the relative advantages of one intervention
over another given the nature of attacks, their perpetrators and motives; and the potential negative side
effects, unintended consequences and trade-offs.125

Monitoring, assessment and reporting
Monitoring, assessment and reporting involve
documenting abuses, analysing their impacts and
using the data and analysis for advocacy as well as to
inform policy development, service delivery and other
responses intended to prevent or remedy these
problems and thereby shield education from attack.
For instance, reporting of threats of attack can be used
to trigger evacuation, temporary closure of schools or
heightened security measures. Documenting military

62

use of schools can facilitate advocacy with the
relevant military authorities to end such use. Accurate
reports of damage and destruction of schools inform
rehabilitation and safety measures. Monitoring and
reporting also play a vital role in accountability.
These objectives may require different types of
monitoring, while channels for reporting will also vary,
depending on the objective. Several mechanisms and
processes provide regular channels for monitoring
and reporting.
UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism on Grave
Violations against Children in Situations of Armed
Conflict
The UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM)
on Grave Violations against Children in Situations of
Armed Conflict was established in 2005 through
Security Council Resolution 1612 to end six grave violations:
• Recruitment or use of children by armed forces
or armed groups
• Killing or maiming of children
• Rape and other grave sexual violence against
children
• Attacks against schools and hospitals
• Denial of humanitarian access to children
• Abduction of children
Each year, the UN Secretary-General produces a report
to the UN Security Council on children and armed
conflict that includes in its annexes a list naming
parties to conflict who have committed one or more of
the four ‘trigger’ violations.126 One of the most significant developments during the reporting period was
the passing of UN Security Council Resolution 1998 in
July 2011, which made attacks on schools and
hospitals one of those trigger violations.127 In 2012 and
2013, the Taliban forces in Afghanistan (including the
Tora Bora Front, the Jamat Sunat al-Dawa Salafia and
the Latif Mansur Network), Forces démocratiques de
libération du Rwanda (FDLR) in DRC, Islamic State of
Iraq/Al-Qaida in Iraq, and the Syrian Armed Forces,
intelligence forces and the Shabbiha militia in Syria
were listed as parties that attacked schools and
hospitals.128

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

A working group of the UN Security Council has a
number of means to urge the listed party to change its
behaviour to stop grave violations against children,
including submissions to Security Council sanctions
committees, referral to the International Criminal
Court and field visits.129 To be delisted, the UN must
verify that the party has ended the grave violation. This
is most often achieved through the party implementing an action plan agreed with the UN to end,
address and prevent the grave violation.
The first time that a party to the conflict is listed in a
specific country, this should lead to the MRM being
established to provide timely, reliable and objective
information on the six grave violations.130 The MRM in
any given country is managed by the Country Task
Force co-chaired by the UNICEF Representative and the
UN Resident Coordinator in countries without a UN
Mission, and by the UNICEF Representative and the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General in
peacekeeping or special political mission settings
where there is a Department of Political Affairs or
Department for Peacekeeping Operations Mission.
The findings of the Country Task Forces are reported to
the UN Secretary-General and distributed via the
Secretary-General’s annual report on children and
armed conflict, through the Secretary-General’s
country-specific reports on children and armed
conflict, and through a quarterly internal Global
Horizontal Note that provides regular updates on the
situation in all MRM countries.131 Information collected
by the Country Task Forces is also used to develop
appropriate responses to the violations.
While the MRM covers an important niche for
monitoring and reporting, it is specifically established
to monitor the situation for schools and does not
include attacks on higher education. Also, it is limited
to situations of armed conflict, and is not tasked with
reporting on the overall impact of attacks on children’s
access to education or on the prevention and
response measures taken to protect the education
system, personnel and students.132 The MRM only
covers reported incidents that it has been able to
verify and therefore may miss cases where monitors
lack access or where they cannot otherwise secure
accurate information. The information the MRM

presents, therefore, will always be about patterns of
attacks but will not always give the complete number
of attacks.
For the reasons given above, so far the MRM has
operated in a limited number of countries – typically
around 13-14 in any given year. It did operate in many
of the countries that were very heavily or heavily
affected by attacks on education in 2009-2012, but it
did not operate in all of them, or in a number of other
profiled countries in which a significant pattern of
attacks on education took place.
In the majority of countries affected by attacks on
education, there remains a need to further strengthen
monitoring and reporting partnerships between UN
agencies, international NGOs, human rights and
development NGOs, and education ministries and
district education offices to improve data collection
and verification of data, and better inform the range of
responses.
There are a number of examples of strong collaboration to draw from.
The Education Cluster
Education clusters,133 which are present in all major
humanitarian emergencies and many post-crisis
settings, including in 19 of the countries profiled in
this study, can play a positive role in assessing the
impact of attacks on education, as well as in
monitoring attacks and military use and sharing information to stop them from occurring. Education cluster
coordinators and information officers have been
instrumental in several countries in developing tools
for data collection, and they have been collating,
analysing and using information on attacks on
schools and their impact, for example, to assess the
financial costs and programming needs for appropriate response and to advocate with key partners. In
Côte d’Ivoire, the Education Cluster, with the full
cooperation of the Ministry of Education, was the
catalyst for a nationwide survey on the impact of the
post-election conflict on schools in 2010-2011, which
involved head teachers in collecting data for the
survey.134 In South Sudan, the Cluster developed and
disseminated briefing notes on military use of schools
and collected data that were useful in negotiations
with armed forces to vacate schools. The success of

63

PART I — GLOBAL OveRvIeW

these examples demonstrates that education clusters
at country level could have an important role in
encouraging wider involvement in monitoring,
assessment and the use of collected data to inform a
full range of responses. Education clusters can also
work with child protection clusters to develop
integrated inter-cluster responses. In Israel/Palestine,
the Working Group on Grave Violations against
Children has developed such an approach between
the Child Protection and Education Clusters.135
Government
Ministries and government bodies have monitored
threats as well as the impact of attacks on education
as part of their duty to provide education. In many
contexts, they are well placed to do so because
collecting data on student enrolment, attendance and
learning achievements and on teacher attendance
and teaching standards, as well as on school infrastructure and learning materials, is a core part of their
work.
However, some governments either lack the political
will or the capacity to monitor and respond to attacks
on education. In some situations, they may
themselves be complicit in, or responsible for, violations against students or education personnel or for
the military use of education facilities. Governments
may also resist or block international monitoring, even
of the activities of rebel groups, for political reasons.
Civil society
Monitoring, data collection, assessment and reporting
by civil society, community-based organizations, and
national and international NGOs have continued to
grow. The development of local organizations’
capacity to do this requires further support. At the
international level, Human Rights Watch, Watchlist on
Children and Armed Conflict, CARE and others have
published in-depth investigations in recent years.
The most glaring gap in data collection is the absence
of global monitoring of attacks on higher education,
although rescue networks and Education International
do provide international alerts about the cases of
individuals. In recent years, Scholars at Risk launched
a monitoring project tracking violent and coercive
attacks on higher education in a range of countries

64

and regions.136 There is a good deal of media reporting
of such attacks but this study represents the first
attempt to report on the full range of attacks on higher
education globally. However, the methods for
continuing to report globally will need to be
strengthened over the coming years.

Accountability and ending impunity
The legal framework protecting education
Attacks on education may violate international human
rights law, international humanitarian law (also known
as the laws of war) or international criminal law,
depending on the context. Although these are distinct
legal regimes, they overlap and are increasingly interlinked. Each contains rules that protect education
explicitly, or protect the conditions necessary for
education provision, such as the protection of educational facilities and the lives of students and
education staff.137 The right to education is guaranteed
under international human rights law in both conflict
and non-conflict situations where states have ratified
the relevant treaties,138 with primary education to be
compulsory and available free to all and other levels of
education to be available and/or equally accessible to
all.139 Its protection is most effective, however, where
states have taken national measures to implement
these treaty provisions. States may also be bound by
human rights and other legal provisions through
customary international law, which applies to all
states regardless of whether they have ratified a
relevant treaty.
In situations of armed conflict, both international
human rights law and international humanitarian law
apply. The latter offers protections to students and
education staff under its general provision for
protecting civilians,140 and to education facilities
insofar as such property is civilian, is not a military
objective and its seizure or destruction is not justified
by imperative military necessity.141 Further, international humanitarian law seeks to protect the
educational needs of particularly vulnerable groups,
notably children, by ensuring that their education
continues uninterrupted during armed conflict.142 The
use of schools and universities in support of a military
effort is restricted under international humanitarian
law but not prohibited in all circumstances.143

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Under international criminal law, certain acts attract
individual criminal responsibility – for example, wilful
killing of civilians, torture, wanton destruction or
seizure of enemy property, and attacks on civilian
objects (including education facilities). Under the
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,144
there is a specific reference to the prohibition of intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated
to education provided they are not military objectives.145 Insofar as inhumane acts such as torture,
imprisonment and forced disappearance are part of a
widespread or systematic attack on a civilian
population (including students, scholars, and
teachers) – even where there is no nexus with armed
conflict – they may be considered crimes against
humanity and therefore prosecutable under international criminal law.146
National law may have even greater potential to deter
attacks than international law. National legislation is a
key piece of the legal framework, enabling domestic
enforcement of protections and prosecutions of
perpetrators. The incorporation into national law of,
for example, Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court would promise greater
deterrence and accountability as well as give more
visibility to the protection of education in law.
Comparatively few countries, however, have included
attacks on educational facilities as a crime within their
national criminal or military laws. According to the
Coalition for the International Criminal Court, 65
countries have enacted domestic legislation implementing the crimes contained in the Rome Statute,
while another 35 countries have some form of
advanced draft of implementing legislation.147
Some countries have also introduced legislation,
jurisprudence or military policies restricting, and in
some cases completely prohibiting, the military use of
schools or universities, although this injunction is not
always consistently enforced. Examples include
Argentina,148 Colombia,149 Ecuador,150 India,151
Ireland,152 the Philippines,153 Poland,154 South Sudan155
and the UK.156
In the Philippines, for example, the practice of military
use of schools has been explicitly banned under both
national legislation and military policy157 – although

incidents continue to be reported.158 A draft law was
also under consideration that would criminalize the
occupation of schools.159 Further legal measures to
address the problem of attacks have been proposed
by a bill that would increase the penalty for electionrelated violence and another that would make election
service voluntary for teachers and other citizens, since
violence against teachers and schools is frequently
connected with their use during elections.160 These are
promising steps for increasing accountability, though
their effectiveness will ultimately depend on the
extent to which they are enforced.
In order to promote greater protection of schools and
universities during armed conflict, GCPEA has worked
with a range of stakeholders to develop and promote
the Lucens Guidelines for Protecting Schools and
Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict,
international guidelines that urge all parties to armed
conflict not to use schools and universities for any
purpose in support of their military effort.161 These
guidelines respect international law as it stands, are
not legally binding in themselves and do not affect
existing obligations under international law. They also
reflect evidence of good practice already applied by
some parties to armed conflict to avoid impinging on
students’ safety and education. They are intended to
lead to a shift in behaviour that will contribute to
better protections for schools and universities in times
of armed conflict and, in particular, to a reduction in
their use by the fighting forces of parties to armed
conflict in support of the military effort.162 These guidelines are discussed further in this report in the essay
‘Military use of schools and universities: changing
behaviour’.
Strengthening accountability
It is clear that a strong legal framework for the right to
education and the protection of education exists,
even though there may be ways it can still be further
enhanced. However, impunity for those responsible
for attacking education is a persistent problem.
Accountability means, in its most basic sense,
ensuring there are adverse consequences for those
who perpetrate abuses.163 This is important for
purposes of justice, both as an end in itself and
because it can play a key role in peace-building by

65

PART I — GLOBAL OveRvIeW

addressing the causes of conflict through legitimate
and just ways. It can also have a deterrent effect,
contributing to the prevention of future attacks164 –
although it may also be the case that conflict
continues because one or more parties does not want
to face justice.
There are a range of effective mechanisms and means
for holding perpetrators to account available at local,
national and international levels, the appropriateness
of which depend, for example, on the nature of the
perpetrator, where the perpetrator is to be held
accountable and whether or not an issue can be
addressed domestically.165 This range covers, for
example, civilian criminal trials, military trials, civil
suits, travel bans and the freezing of financial assets
for holding individual perpetrators to account in
domestic fora, and truth commissions and traditional
justice mechanisms for both individuals and states or
non-state groups. Victims may also be awarded
reparation.166
At the international level, individual perpetrators may
be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC)
or other international tribunals or have international
travel bans and asset freezes imposed; meanwhile,
accountability for states may be increased by mechanisms such as the UN Security Council (including
through the UN MRM, mentioned above), the Human
Rights Council, the Committee on the Rights of the
Child (CRC) and other treaty bodies,167 regional human
rights courts and commissions, or by sanctions or
other embargoes.168 States – as opposed to individual
leaders or military commanders – cannot be prosecuted criminally; therefore, holding them accountable
includes increasing the costs to their international
diplomacy through stigmatization or ‘naming and
shaming’ and by imposing punitive sanctions, where
appropriate.169
While no one has yet been charged specifically for
attacks on education facilities under the relevant
provisions of the Rome Statute by the ICC, a handful of
cases already on the Court’s docket – and one that has
been successfully prosecuted – have mentioned the
issue of attacks on schools or the effects that
recruitment of children as soldiers can have on
education.170 For example, both the closing arguments

66

and sentencing submission by the Prosecution in the
first case at the ICC, against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo
from the DRC, as well as several submissions during
the reparations phase, included references to the
impact that the crime of child recruitment had on
education.171 In the case investigated against Sudan’s
President, Omar al-Bashir, with respect to atrocities in
Darfur, he has been charged with multiple attacks on
the civilian population of Darfur that took place from
March 2003 to 14 July 2008 as part of the counterinsurgency campaign. These attacks included the
bombing of schools where a large proportion of
victims were children.172
The deterrent effect of the Rome Statute against
criminal violations during armed conflict that
constitute attacks on education would be enhanced if
ICC investigations were carried out with a view to
bringing charges against high-profile leaders who are
alleged to have issued orders to attack schools or kill
teachers or students for going to school.
UN human rights treaty bodies and other international
human rights mechanisms have also, in several cases,
begun to include attacks on education in their observations, calling on states to address the impacts of
attacks that violate the right to education and to hold
perpetrators to account.173 The CRC – the treaty body
established under the Convention on the Rights of the
Child which requires signatories to submit reports
every five years for review upon which recommendations for enhancing protections are then made174 – is
one treaty body that has made recommendations
regarding attacks on schools and military use to
several countries. For example, in 2013 it issued
concluding observations on the second to fourth
periodic reports of Israel, which expressed concern
over a range of attacks on schools and students as
well as severe classroom shortages and restrictions on
freedom of movement that impinge on access to
education for some Palestinian children.175
In addition, there are a handful of examples of
domestic accountability mechanisms that have been
used in response to attacks on school buildings or
military use of schools. For example, in India, where
security forces used more than 129 schools during
2010 alone,176 the Supreme Court issued a ruling

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

ordering the forces out.177 In general, however, considerably less is known at present regarding local or
national investigations and prosecutions for violations committed against students, education staff and
education facilities. A study published by Conflict
Dynamics International in 2011 suggests that nationallevel mechanisms have real potential to contribute to
improved accountability, but that most do not prioritize children affected by armed conflict. Technical
capacity and funding are also lacking.178 Therefore,
there is a need to encourage and support countries to
provide these requirements.

from school or lining the road to and from school with
security forces, as well as issuing firearms licenses for
teachers to carry weapons as a means of self-defence
en route to and from school.181 In response to
extortion-related kidnap threats issued to schools in
Mexico, municipal authorities in 2009 dispatched
hundreds of police cadets to patrol the targeted
school surroundings,182 while a local governmentcreated programme in Acapulco, called ‘Safe School’,
increased security personnel in and around the
schools in 2011 and installed alarm buttons in school
buildings.183

While encouraging steps have been taken to increase
accountability for attacks, these are relatively few
when compared with the number of violations
documented by this study alone. Advocacy to
strengthen accountability and reduce impunity for
perpetrators who commit violations of law that
constitute attacks on education remains a pressing
need at both international and national levels. To be
better able to draw lessons and address gaps, more
information is also needed regarding the enforcement
of national legislation and the use of domestic
accountability mechanisms.

Although an elevated risk of attack or a general
security situation may warrant the use of physical
protection measures in some cases, these measures
can have unintended negative consequences that
need to be considered carefully. Reinforcing school
infrastructure may make it more attractive for military
use, for example. Furthermore, the presence of
guards, police or other armed personnel, when they
are themselves the intended targets of violence, can
put students and teachers at increased risk of
attack.184

Enhancing security on the ground

A variety of negotiated responses to attacks have been
attempted, in particular to military use of schools. In
some cases, negotiations have been conducted by
local communities or community leaders with armed
groups or government forces; in others, they have
been undertaken by government officials, depending
on the context and nature of attacks. Negotiations
have involved dialogue and consensus-building
among parties to the conflict and education stakeholders around the types of behaviour that are
permissible on school grounds, the negative impact of
military use, the politicization of schools or the
content of the curriculum. Agreements may declare a
ban on weapons within a defined area, prohibit
political propaganda on school grounds, restrict the
military use of schools or order the vacating of schools
by armed groups or security forces, establish codes of
conduct for military and armed groups, or dictate other
terms relevant locally.185

Many different protection measures have been used in
high-risk areas to shield potential targets, minimize
damage from attacks or provide means of selfdefence.179 These have included assigning armed or
unarmed guards to education institutions, establishing checkpoints near schools, reinforcing school
infrastructure such as building walls around school
perimeters, making housing available for students or
personnel near or on campus, providing a protective
presence or escorts to accompany students or
teachers en route to and from schools, offering safer
modes of transportation and arming teachers.
For example, in Iraq, in response to child abductions
and recruitment, the Ministry of Education instructed
schools to take precautions and security patrols and
checkpoints around schools were increased.180 In
Thailand, the government – due in part to teacher
trade union demands – has for a long time emphasized the use of hard protection measures such as
providing military escorts for teachers travelling to and

Negotiated solutions

Negotiations to cease or prevent military use of
schools during the reporting period have also

67

PART I — GLOBAL OveRvIeW

succeeded in some cases. For example, in Somalia,
the UN has collected and used data on military use of
education facilities to secure the agreement of military
commanders to vacate schools.186 In some instances,
negotiations have taken place successfully with
armed forces and groups at local level to ban certain
practices from school grounds, such as occupation
and use of schools and looting and burning of learning
materials and classroom furniture. In South Sudan,
community leaders and Parent Teacher Associations
(PTAs) play a central role, acting as steering
committees for county commissioners who negotiate
with government security forces.187
Dialogue initiated by ministries of education or UN
partners with ministries of defence and leaders of the
national armed forces has led the latter to issue a
number of military directives to vacate school
premises, for instance in South Sudan.188 In Mali, the
education ministry and the UN engaged in dialogue
with the defence ministry and a number of schools
were subsequently vacated.189 In DRC, UN-led intervention with military leaders resulted in the national
armed forces vacating schools.190
Community-driven negotiations to develop and agree
to codes of conduct have also been undertaken in
countries such as Nepal and the Philippines, where a
number of communities have established
programmes whereby schools or ‘learning institutions’ become recognized as ‘Zones of Peace’ (SZOP
and LIZOP, respectively). In Nepal, one of the key
components of the SZOP programme was the writing
and signing of codes of conduct defining what was
and was not allowed on school grounds in order to
minimize violence, school closures and the politicization of schooling. For instance, terms of the code
in some cases included: ‘No arrest or abduction of any
individual within the premises’, ‘no use of school to
camp’ or ‘no use of school as an armed base’. This was
achieved through collaboration among diverse
political and ethnic groups in widely publicized mass
meetings.191 The signatory parties kept their commitments, in general, and these efforts helped
communities to keep schools open, improving
protection as well as school governance.192

In the Philippines, codes of conduct developed collaboratively have been used to encourage armed groups
and government forces to protect and promote
children’s right to education and the human rights of
teachers and other education personnel. They are
asked to sign up to morally binding commitments to
abide by the codes. According to a case study of LIZOP
at a school in Maguindanao province, this process
opened space for dialogue among the community and
other stakeholders on how to better protect and
ensure the continuity of schooling for their children,
and provided ‘an opportunity for actors in conflict to
become actors in building learning spaces that are
safe and secure’, with members of armed groups
involved in both agreeing and signing the LIZOP declaration.193
Concerns regarding negotiation include potential risks
to the mediator and representatives of the parties
involved in the dialogue in dealing with armed nonstate groups; whether to use local or international
mediators and how they will be perceived by the
parties in the negotiations; whether to hold talks in
private or publicly; and how far to compromise on
education policy and curriculum for short-term
security gains without undermining the quality of, or
access to, education in future.

Community responses
The limited amount of research that has been carried
out on the subject supports the view of some international agencies and NGOs that responses initiated
by communities may have a key role to play in
protecting schools.194 Communities can be involved in
all of the types of response discussed in this study and
contribute to protection in a range of ways. These may
include the involvement of school management
committees in protecting schools, students and
teachers; the establishment of school defence
committees; the involvement of communities in the
construction, maintenance and protection of schools
including as night-watchmen or security guards; the
use of parents and other community members as
student and teacher escorts or a protective presence;
and the development of community alert systems,
community-based schooling, and community-led
protests, negotiations and monitoring.

70

These responses may be generated and implemented
by communities with little or no external support in
some instances. In other cases, they may be developed
and managed by communities in consultation with, or
with technical or financial support from, external
organizations or government partners. Different forms
of engagement may be more or less feasible
depending on the context, the nature of attacks and
community values with regard to education.
For example, in DRC in 2012, Education Cluster
partners worked at school level with students,
teachers and parents to analyse risks, including
protection-related threats resulting from conflict and
insecurity, and to develop risk reduction plans.195 In
Myanmar, local organizations and communities
developed systems for monitoring, negotiating with
armed groups and providing physical protection.196 In
Palestine, UNESCO helped to support the establishment of an alert system via text messages on
mobile phones, building on the initiative of parents
who call teachers in the morning to ensure that school
routes are safe. The system helps warn students,
teachers and parents when and where incidents are
occurring.197
Knowledge of the comparative effectiveness of
different types of community response remains
limited. It is generally accepted that community
involvement is a critical component for improving the
protection of education.198 However, more research is
needed on what makes community-level interventions
effective and their long-term impact. This issue is
explored further in the essay: ‘The role of communities
in protecting education’ later in this study.

Education policy and planning
In areas where there are persistent attacks, education
ministries and departments can take steps to help
prevent future incidents, reduce the impact of ongoing
attacks and ensure affected schools recover in a
timely way. When rebuilding, rehabilitation and
resupply work is slow, it can lengthen the denial of
access to good quality education by years. If curricula,
teacher recruitment policies or resource allocation are
a source of tension, failing to address them may mean
that attacks continue or recur. Conflict-sensitive
education policy and planning measures that take into

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

account the need to both prevent attacks on
education and respond to attacks where they do occur
are therefore critical to improving protection.
Strengthening the elements of education for peaceful
resolution of conflicts, respect for human rights and
responsible citizenship in the curriculum may also
help reduce the recurrence of conflict and build peace.
One important aspect of educational planning in
ensuring the recovery of the education system is
making funds and other resources available to rebuild
and repair schools. Every year that passes without a
school being rehabilitated and reopened can mean a
lost year of education for its students. But rehabilitating schools where large numbers have been
destroyed, as in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, is
a very heavy burden that may require sustained, largescale collaboration with international donors and
NGOs to fill gaps in funding. Investment on this scale
is only possible where attacks have been halted,
which requires intervention to avert or deter attacks
and resolve conflict over education issues.199
Where unequal access to quality education is a source
of tension, as was the case in Sierra Leone, establishing fair and transparent criteria for allocating
resources may be an important contributor to ending
grievances that can lead to attacks.200 Transparency in
education system governance and resource allocation
is also vital for restoring trust. In Nepal, for instance,
after years of unequal distribution of education
resources, the government tried to ensure resources
went to where they were really needed within conflictaffected areas by introducing district-level
micro-planning.201 It also sought to improve governance and transparency by encouraging parental
involvement in school management via PTAs, making
school governance bodies more inclusive and introducing fiscal audits.202
Curriculum reform, changes to teacher recruitment
and management, and increased community
involvement that seeks to address the grievances of
particular groups may also help to prevent attacks
motivated by perceived bias or the imposition of alien
cultural values, history, religion or language. In Nepal,
the latest editions of social studies textbooks now
include education for human rights, peace and

civics.203 Moreover, the provincial education authorities in the southernmost provinces of Thailand
decided that protection against attacks on schools
and assassinations of teachers could be increased by
changes to education curriculum and staffing policies
and practices. The southern provincial education
offices have instituted a number of policies to improve
protection for teachers and schools, including:
• increasing by five-fold the hours of Islamic
religious instruction in the four provinces where
the ethnic Malay Muslim population is concentrated or predominates and switching from five
to six days a week of schooling to accommodate the extra lessons;
• teaching English, the Malay language and the
local Muslim population’s tribal language;
• funding projects that build relationships with
the local community such as vegetable gardens
for the school;
• transferring Thai Buddhist teachers to city areas
which are safer, supported by subsidies to
cover the extra cost of additional travel to
school;
• recruiting more than 3,000 teachers from the
local community to replace teachers transferred
to other parts of the country;
• requiring students to study at home when
access to school is limited, with community
teachers visiting their homes.204
The aim of these policies is to build relationships and
trust with the local community and encourage them to
protect teachers, students and schools, although it is
difficult to say whether they have affected the number
of attacks.205
The Inter-Agency Network for Education in
Emergencies (INEE), UN agencies and a number of
donors are also increasingly focusing on education
policies and sector plans, as well as NGO and UN
programming that are conflict-sensitive and anticipate
and respond to some of the causes of armed conflict
and associated attacks. The INEE Guiding Principles
on Integrating Conflict Sensitivity in Education Policy
and Programming in Conflict-Affected and Fragile
Contexts were adopted at a high-level meeting

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

convened by INEE and UNESCO in April 2013. INEE has
developed a Guidance Note on Conflict-Sensitive
Education206 and USAID was commissioning work on
conflict-sensitive sector planning in 2013. Protect
Education in Insecurity and Conflict (PEIC) and the
UNESCO International Institute for Educational
Planning are beginning a capacity-building project for
crisis-sensitive education.
Safety measures, including emergency drills, have
become a part of school policy in some places in an
effort to mitigate the impact of potential attacks. In
Mexico, for example, in response to crossfire in
shootouts near to schools, teachers in a number of
states were given training on how to keep their
students safe during gun battles and schools began to
hold drills.207
Aside from protection, a key problem affecting
recovery from attacks is providing continuity of
education for students affected by violence or whose
schools have been destroyed. To ensure this happens,
education authorities must develop and implement
plans which respond to current emergencies and
prepare for future ones; for example, they should
ensure that education is protected and continuous for
displaced populations – whether displaced internally
or across borders – as well as for those who remain in
their place of origin; and that regulations are in place
to guarantee the safety of rebuilt or replaced facilities
as well as the availability of temporary learning facilities in the meantime.208
UN agencies and NGOs frequently supplement
government efforts in areas of conflict by providing
temporary learning spaces for displaced school
populations, often in the form of tented classrooms,
as well as emergency education supplies.209 In
Somalia, for example, the Somali Formal Education
Network, an umbrella group for 55 schools in
Mogadishu and three other regions, helps teachers
follow communities when they are uprooted,
sometimes teaching under trees or tents. When an
area becomes dangerous, the school authorities look
for another location and move to ensure that
education continues.210

Protecting higher education
Most responses to attacks on higher education appear
to focus on either enhancing physical protection or
promoting resilience and adaptability. This study
found no examples of responses in the form of
community protection or turning universities into
‘zones of peace’.211 Alongside the relative dearth of
information about attacks on higher education
compared with attacks on other levels of education,
there is even less about the effectiveness of
responses at the tertiary level.
The physical protection of higher education can take
several forms, including on-campus security guards or
escorts and strengthening gates, fences and windows.
In Colombia, for example, an elaborate protection
scheme for individuals, originally set up for teachers
and teacher trade unionists, was extended to protect
academic and trade union representatives in higher
education. Established by human rights groups,
teacher trade unions, OHCHR and representatives of
the Colombian government, it is providing threatened
or targeted individuals with administrative and
financial support for physical protection measures
and, depending on the type and degree of risk of each
individual case, armed escorts or guards, mobile
phones, bullet-proof vehicles or temporary
relocation.212
A number of measures to promote the resilience of
higher education in response to attacks have also
been taken. Distance learning programmes, such as
those established for Iraq,213 Israel/Palestine214 and
Zimbabwe,215 and scholarship schemes for studying,
teaching or researching abroad have been used to
enable continuity of education where normal teaching
is no longer possible, for instance due to the security
risk of travelling to university. Iraqi academics in exile,
for example, have been able to contribute filmed
lectures to Iraqi universities on specialist subjects
through a Scholar Rescue Fund project.216 In recent
years, scholar protection organizations have also put
an increased focus on funding placements in
countries neighbouring the conflict-affected country to
increase the likelihood of scholars returning to their
homeland when peace is restored.

74

Pressure for greater accountability in higher education
has stemmed primarily from political and human
rights campaigns at local and international levels,
rather than the use of legal instruments, the prosecution of perpetrators or enhanced monitoring and
reporting. Examples include student protests and
demonstrations against repressive measures or the
allegedly excessive use of force by state security
forces; and national and international advocacy
campaigns in support of individual academics or
students. There is no clear evidence regarding the
impact of many such actions.
GCPEA’s research examining the relationship between
autonomy and security concluded that enhancing
university autonomy vis-à-vis the state may in some
situations contribute to reducing or preventing attacks
on higher education, particularly when coupled with
university-controlled internal security provision.217 This
includes developing and extending the notion of the
university as a space outside of direct state control
(even when funding is largely state-provided) – particularly concerning decisions about recruitment,
financial and administrative management, curriculum
and research. It also includes prohibiting state forces
from entering university campuses (unless invited in
by the institutional leadership or in extremely rare
circumstances).218 While university autonomy alone is
insufficient to prevent attacks, many of which occur
outside of university campuses, the research found
that it appears to be an important component of
efforts to improve the protection of higher education.
These issues are explored in greater detail in this
study in the essay: ‘Protecting higher education’.

Advocacy
Advocacy has been undertaken at international,
national and local levels over the past several years to
increase awareness of the problem of attacks and
catalyse improved response and prevention.
Concerted advocacy undertaken by a number of NGOs
and UN agencies seems to have encouraged the
decision to include attacks on schools and hospitals
as a triggering offence for mandated UN monitoring
and reporting of violations against children in armed
conflict through UN Security Council Resolution 1998

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

(2011) and a corresponding increase in reporting in
the UN Secretary-General’s annual report on children
and armed conflict. Awareness-raising efforts have
also contributed to improved coverage of attacks in
these reports.

cations and statements calling for an end to attacks
and for appropriate redress. Collectively, these organizations have raised awareness and put pressure on
perpetrators, including through the use of petitions,
open letters and submissions to human rights bodies.

Advocacy efforts around the right to education in
crisis-affected contexts have also called greater
attention to the issue of attacks. In September 2012,
the UN Secretary-General launched his ‘Global
Education First Initiative’, a five-year strategy to
improve education access and quality worldwide,
which included as its second ‘Key action’: ‘Sustain
education in humanitarian crises, especially in
conflict’.219 To help implement this component of the
agenda, the education-in-emergencies community
met to develop ‘Education Cannot Wait’, which was
launched at an event in September 2012 at the UN
General Assembly bringing together global leaders
from governments, international organizations and
civil society. These leaders endorsed a ‘Call to
Action’220 urging the protection of schools from
attacks, as well as significant increases in humanitarian aid for education and integration of emergency
prevention, preparedness, response and recovery in
education sector plans and budgets.221 An INEE
Education Cannot Wait Advocacy Working Group,
focused on reaching the goals set out in the Call to
Action, was formed and a high-level follow-up event
was held in September 2013 to assess progress and
shortfalls and reaffirm commitments to: ‘plan, prioritize and protect education in crisis-affected
contexts’.222

Education Clusters at country level have used data
collected by education and child protection partners
to advocate with government counterparts to vacate
schools as well as to mobilize funds for the rehabilitation or construction of damaged schools and the
provision of educational materials such as desks and
textbooks. For example, in Côte d’Ivoire, monitoring
information was used for advocacy with the ministries
of education and defence on the issue of attacks on
education; it was also published in the Education
Cluster’s reports.223 Education and child protection
partners undertook awareness-raising activities to
sensitize armed groups to the effects of military use of
schools and to improve their understanding of international humanitarian law, including through training
and visits to military checkpoints and occupied
schools. As a result of these efforts, military
commanders dismantled checkpoints near schools
and armed groups vacated the majority of occupied
schools.224

International human rights organizations such as
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International and
trade union organizations such as Education
International have helped to focus public attention on
the problem of attacks, producing country reports that
cover the issue in-depth in a range of contexts, or
alerts on the plight of students, teachers and
academics who have been arbitrarily imprisoned,
tortured or killed. Other international NGOs such as
CARE, Save the Children and Watchlist on Children and
Armed Conflict have similarly developed thematic
reports and advocacy documents highlighting the
problem. Local human rights groups have also
continued their coverage of attacks, producing publi-

Advocacy has also been undertaken by organizations
or communities directly with governments, armed
forces or armed groups. According to a UN
respondent, advocacy and awareness-raising with the
armed forces in South Sudan increased their understanding of the negative impacts of military use of
schools on education and children’s well-being.225
Subsequently, the number of schools occupied
decreased significantly, as did the length of time from
when a school was reported to be occupied until it was
vacated.226 Then in 2013, the SPLA ordered its troops
to stop using schools.227

Recommendations
The evidence is incontrovertible: attacking schools, universities, students, teachers and academics is a
common tactic in situations of conflict and insecurity around the world. While some progress has been made,
much more can and should be done to protect education from attack.

Monitoring, assessment and reporting
Monitoring, assessment and reporting of attacks on education are essential for many purposes, including
holding those responsible to account, devising effective ways to respond to and prevent attacks, and
addressing their impact.
• Ministries of education, interior and other relevant parts of government should rigorously monitor and
investigate attacks against students, schools and universities, teachers, academics and other education
personnel and the impact of such attacks, and should use that information to devise effective, coordinated responses. International agencies such as the Education and Child Protection clusters, the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), UNICEF, UNESCO and donor governments should
support or continue to support these efforts, involving local NGOs in the monitoring process where
possible.
• UN human rights monitoring mechanisms, including the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights; the Human Rights Committee; the Committee on the Rights of the Child; and the Human Rights
Council and its mechanisms, including the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, should give
greater attention to monitoring and reporting attacks on education at all levels of schooling, where
relevant to their mandates. Governments and civil society organizations, in turn, should submit or
continue to submit to these bodies information about violations of international law that constitute
attacks on education.
• Country task forces of the UN-led MRM on grave violations against children in situations of armed conflict
should enhance monitoring and reporting of attacks on schools, teachers and other persons related to
the school (protected persons); threats of attacks against protected persons; and actions by parties to
the conflict which impede children’s access to education, including the military use of schools, as
requested by the Security Council in Resolution 1998 of July 2011. Although more information is being
gathered, gaps still remain, particularly in certain countries. Steps should include:
° Establishing or strengthening monitoring and reporting partnerships involving NGOs.
° Reporting in more detail about education. For example, country task forces that combine attacks on
schools and hospitals should disaggregate the information. In addition, reporting on killing and
maiming, sexual violence, and recruitment should specify if these violations took place in or en route
to or from schools.
° Linking data collection to action on the ground to prevent or respond to military use of schools and
attacks on schools and protected personnel, including, where appropriate, collaborating with
education ministries and authorities to better inform and trigger responses to attacks and monitor the
effectiveness of response measures.

76

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

International and national legal protections
Notwithstanding the existence of a strong framework of international law in favour of the right to education and
the protection of education, the number of attacks on education and the impunity of most perpetrators indicate
that much remains to be done to further strengthen legal protections and accountability mechanisms at international and national levels.
• All parties to armed conflicts should abide by the laws of war and never intentionally direct attacks
against civilians – such as students, teachers or other education personnel – who are not taking direct
part in hostilities. Nor should they intentionally direct attacks against buildings dedicated to education –
such as schools and universities – provided they are not military objectives.
• Government officials and leaders of armed non-state groups should make clear public statements that
attacks on education are prohibited, issue clear orders to this effect and refrain from using education
institutions for military purposes.
• States should ensure that their domestic law criminalizes all elements of attacks on education in line
with international humanitarian and human rights law.
• Where they have not done so, states should ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, which protects the right to education at all levels.
• Relevant UN treaty-based human rights bodies and other international and regional monitoring and
supervisory bodies should offer coherent and coordinated guidance to states (and, where relevant, nonstate actors) on the measures required to implement their obligations under international law with
respect to attacks on education. States and armed non-state groups should, in turn, implement these
bodies’ recommendations.
• All parties to peace agreements and mediators should ensure that issues concerning attacks on
education be included in any post-conflict agreement and that international legal protections for
education are explicitly articulated.

Military use of schools and universities
The use of schools and universities for military purposes during armed conflict can displace students and
deprive them of an education, create a wholly inappropriate learning environment, or even place students,
teachers and academics – and schools and universities – at risk of attack.
• All parties to armed conflict should refrain from using schools and universities for any purpose in support
of the military effort. While certain uses may not be contrary to the laws of war, all parties should
endeavour to avoid impinging on students’ safety and education.
• To this end, states, as well as UN and regional peacekeepers, should support and endorse the Lucens
Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict and incorporate them into military doctrine, military manuals, rules of engagement, operational orders and other
means of dissemination, as far as possible, to encourage appropriate practice throughout the chain of
command.

77

PART I — GLOBAL OveRvIeW

Accountability
Perpetrators of attacks must be held responsible, where appropriate, in domestic, regional and international
fora through judicial and non-judicial mechanisms. Others who are responsible for putting education at risk of
attack or for failing to fulfil their responsibility to prevent or respond to attacks should also be held to account.
• States should, in accordance with international standards, systematically investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute those individuals responsible for ordering, taking part in, or bearing command
responsibility for, the range of violations of international law that constitute attacks against education.
• Tribunals at regional and international levels should similarly give specific consideration to the range of
violations that constitute attacks against education during relevant investigations and pursue and
prosecute cases of sufficient gravity over which they have jurisdiction. When considering awards of
reparation, tribunals should consider the full effect of such attacks.
• Informal and transitional justice mechanisms, such as commissions of inquiry and truth and reconciliation commissions, should, where relevant, recognize and concretely address attacks against education
at all stages in their processes, including in fact-finding and any reparations.

Protective programmes, policies and planning
In areas where attacks occur, implementing effective measures to prevent, respond to and mitigate the impacts
of attacks is critical. All interventions should be tailored to context and conflict dynamics and, where possible,
should be based on assessment and evaluation of what works and why.
• Governments, NGOs and UN agencies should involve communities, including marginalized and
vulnerable groups, in analysing the nature of attacks, as well as programme design and delivery.
Community engagement should not come at the expense of community members’ safety.
• Donors should ensure flexibility in both programme design and funding to allow for interventions to be
tailored to context and to change course as needed.
• UN agencies, NGOs and relevant ministries should undertake conflict analysis to avoid unintentionally
increasing or transferring risk.
• UN agencies, NGOs and education ministries should pay particular attention to the impact of violent
attacks on girls’ and women’s education and devise appropriate programmes of prevention, response
and recovery.
• UN agencies, NGOs, peacekeeping forces and governments, where appropriate and where security
concerns allow, should undertake negotiations with parties to a conflict, or support such negotiations, to
reach agreement on respect for schools as safe sanctuaries and the re-opening of closed schools.
• States should take steps towards de-linking education facilities, staff and students from electoral tasks
and partisan political events in contexts where it can be reasonably expected that such linkages would
heighten the risk of attacks.
• Education ministries should adopt conflict-sensitive curricula and resourcing policies to ensure that
education does not help trigger conflict and become a target for attack.

78

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

• Education ministries and international agencies should support in policy and practice the development
of contingency plans to ensure that schools and universities are equipped to respond to attacks and
resume educational activities as soon as possible.
• Academics, practitioners and education providers, including international and local organizations,
should conduct rigorously designed in-country and comparative research to illuminate what programmes
successfully protect education and why, taking into account the fact that attacks are often highly contextspecific. All actors should make use of available relevant research to inform their responses.

Higher education
Greater efforts are needed to strengthen the protection, and promote the resilience, of higher education institutions. Stronger guarantees of university autonomy, academic freedom and security are essential in the face of a
wide variety of attacks and threats.
• States should publicly affirm their responsibilities to protect higher education from attack, including
abstaining from direct or complicit involvement in attacks and preventing and deterring attacks. This
should include conducting thorough investigations of any incidents which occur, reporting findings in an
open and transparent way, and holding perpetrators accountable under law.
• All states should promote the security and autonomy of higher education institutions at all times and
prevent violence and intimidation against academics. To this end, states should encourage, within higher
education communities and society generally, a culture of respect for institutional autonomy, including
rejection of external ideological or political interference. Suitable measures may include new policies,
regulations and laws that promote both institutional autonomy and the security of higher education
communities.
• States and other relevant organizations should do everything in their power to protect higher education
personnel from threats and danger, including by providing support to those who seek refuge from such
threats or danger in another country.
• More information about the nature, scale and impact of attacks on higher education is needed. States,
higher education institutions and professionals, UN and international agencies, and NGOs should
support and expand research on and monitoring of attacks on higher education communities.

he following section consists of three essays commissioned for this study and written
by independent experts. The essays focus on themes critical for improving response
to, and prevention of, attacks on education: the role of communities in protecting
education, the protection of higher education and the changing of military behaviour
regarding the use of schools and universities. These pieces are intended to provide greater
depth of analysis on several dimensions of protecting education and to highlight ways
forward for strengthening the effectiveness of protective and preventive measures.

The role of communities
in protecting education
The limited amount of research that has been
undertaken on programmes to protect
education suggests that communities have a
crucial role to play in preventing and
responding to attacks.228 However, less is
known about the outcomes of community
engagement or the conditions for its success.
This chapter summarizes key findings across a
range of protection measures – such as physical
protection, monitoring, advocacy and negotiation – in which communities have played an
active part. Different approaches to engaging
with communities are analysed and lessons are
drawn with the aim of improving support for the
protection of education at the local level
Communities have an important role to play in
protecting education from attack.229 In many conflictaffected countries in particular, governments may lack
the capacity or will to fully protect education.230 For
example, in northern Liberia, where attacks on
students and schools continued to occur after the
conflict, some communities organized student escorts
and provided unarmed guards at schools to improve
their physical security.231 Communities in Afghanistan
have protected schools in instances where they know
and are able to negotiate with the perpetrators of
attack.232 Often, national and international actors can
support community action. In Nepal, for example,
NGO investments in capacity-building ensured that
school management committees were more representative of the community and reportedly reduced
threats to education.However, a community-based
approach can present certain risks to the individuals
involved. In eastern DRC and Nepal, community
members monitoring attacks have reported being
threatened.233

82

Despite the worldwide engagement of communities in
protecting education, very little research, either
quantitative or qualitative, has taken place on the
outcomes of these actions.234 This essay summarizes
available documentation on this topic, based on a
review of existing literature and selected programme
documents as well as practitioner experience. The
analysis draws on the Interagency Learning Initiative’s
(ILI) typology of ways of engaging communities in
activities to achieve children’s well-being.235 The fourcategory typology of community participation in
protection interventions proposed by the ILI has been
adapted and used for this review: communityinitiated, community-implemented,
community-inspired and community-involved. The
analysis of community action presented draws, in
particular, upon two in-depth case studies of the
Philippines and Afghanistan prepared for this chapter.
Based on the review, suggestions are offered on ways
that national or international actors can support
community action.

Community action to prevent and
respond to attack
Communities are engaged in preventive, damagemitigating and responsive actions designed to ensure
continued safe access to education. These actions can
be undertaken independently or with varying degrees
of support from government, civil society or international organizations. Work at the community level is
facilitated through national-level education policies
that are conflict-sensitive and through curriculum
reform to remove bias and build students’ capacity for
conflict resolution. The present chapter, however,
examines only modalities of action specifically at
community level.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Forms of education protection in which communities are engaged
Preventive actions, such as:
• strengthening management of education
• negotiation to prevent attacks
• establishing ‘Codes of Conduct’/’Schools as Zones of Peace’ with the
objective of long-term prevention of attacks
• awareness-raising on the value of education
• roll-out of, and awareness-raising on, national legislation
• advocacy
• adaptation of education delivery
• physical strengthening of schools, construction and reconstruction
• night guards/day guards/security
• protests

Damage mitigation, such as:
• contingency planning
• safety and first aid training
• extinguishing fires in case of arson attacks
• early warning systems: Short Message Service (SMS) warning teachers and
students of attack

Response actions, such as:
• facilitating speedy resumption of education when safety permits
• support for temporary learning spaces and psychosocial support
• monitoring and reporting
• capturing lessons learned in order to be able to carry out further preventive
action
• negotiation – e.g. for the clearing of school buildings used by armed
groups and state armed forces, or the release of teachers or students
• reconstruction and repairs

Preventive actions
Strengthening management
In many countries, school management often includes
not only senior education staff but also a school
management committee composed of community
representatives. However, particularly in unstable
settings, school management may be politicized or
biased, discriminating against members of certain
cultural, linguistic, ethnic or religious minorities,
thereby potentially making schools more vulnerable to
attack.236 Ensuring the full participation of excluded
groups in school management committees may
reduce threats to schools, teachers and students.237 In
Nepal, there seemed to be a correlation between
democratic elections to select committee members
and reduced threat of attack.238 In Afghanistan,
community involvement in the management of
schools encouraged greater vigilance against
attack.239 In addition, representative management
structures may more effectively implement other
protective actions outlined below. However, the
voluntary nature of these committees can lead to slow
progress, high turnover or lack of willingness to participate.240

Negotiation
Many instances have shown that local actors,
including school management committees,
community and religious leaders, and village elders,
may be effective at negotiating with potential perpetrators of attacks, particularly when the attackers are
trying to gain the community’s support or are
community members themselves. Religious leaders
and religious groups may also have greater success in
negotiating with parties to conflict when they draw
from similar belief systems.241
In one case in Nepal, a Village Development Council
successfully lobbied to locate election booths in
community buildings instead of schools to ensure that
education facilities retained a politically neutral
profile.242
The approach taken to negotiations depends upon the
perpetrators and motives of attack. At times, transparent and public negotiations may be most effective
since they ensure awareness of agreements, for

84

example, through public ceremonies.243 Alternatively,
back-door negotiations may be more appropriate
where discussion with certain parties to the conflict
would present a risk for negotiators. For example, in
Nepal, secret negotiations took place with Maoist
rebels so that individuals – mostly women – involved
in discussions on the subject of Schools as Zones of
Peace would not be put in jeopardy.244

Codes of Conduct/Zones of Peace
Codes of Conduct are a particular type of negotiation
that can be long-term and prevent school attacks.
‘Schools as Zones of Peace’ (SZOP) have been established in many areas and international organizations
can play a major role in encouraging communities to
engage in such a process. A mid-term evaluation by
Save the Children noted 12 of 16 of their project
schools in Nepal had Codes of Conduct regarding
SZoP.245
UN agencies and NGOs promoting SZOPs have often
found it beneficial to work through local partners,
whose staff speak local languages and understand the
context, enabling long-term relationship-building,
meaningful participation from all stakeholders,
including schools and their communities, and
contextual relevance.246 The negotiation process may
be lengthy and requires patience, flexibility and trust.
In Baglung, Nepal, for example, Maoists initially
rejected a declaration of the school as a SZOP, but
allowed it as they became more integrated into the
community.247
Additionally, including clauses that target all participants’ behaviour – not just armed groups and forces –
has been effective in places like Nepal. There, clauses
covered concerns such as armed activities and
weapons in school; use of children in political activities; abduction; use of inappropriate language; and
use of alcohol and tobacco.248

Adaptation of education delivery
Schools may be targets for attack because they are
large physical structures, are a source for human
resources or have symbolic meaning. Consequently,
changes in physical set-up or content may be
protective; for example, reducing visibility by means of
boundary walls, relocating schools or holding classes

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

in homes or community premises, or changing
curriculum, staffing or teaching. However, these
changes must be made with an awareness of how they
might adversely affect education quality.249

Guards/security
Armed or unarmed guards may provide security,
reduce the risk of attack or enable rapid response to
attack. Because government provision of security can
attract attacks in some cases, community guards may
be a logical alternative. In Liberia, the community
viewed unarmed guards as a relatively cost-effective
and sustainable protection mechanism that helped
teachers and students feel safe.250 However,
depending on the context, having community guards
may simply transfer the risk.

Protest
Community protests against attacks on education
have occurred in several countries including Pakistan,
Yemen and India. For example, in India, students and
teachers in Jharkhand organized a protest after
Maoists blew up a school in 2011.251 While protests
draw attention to threats to education, they can
present considerable risks for communities,
subjecting them to further violence. External actors,
therefore, should not initiate community protest
though they can support wider awareness of the
issues being raised.

Response actions
Promoting continuity of education provision
Because of their immediate proximity, communities
can be first responders for restoring access to
education and mitigating the impact of attacks, for
example, by repairing damaged buildings. NGOs may
also engage community members in the process of
fundraising, and provision of materials and labour to
rebuild. Save the Children’s global programme for
education in conflict-affected states included the
mobilization of communities in locations such as
Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Iraq and Nepal to repair
damaged school buildings or build new structures,
leading to increased access to education.252 Doing so
may instil a sense of community ownership of the
school, further protecting education. However,

standards need to be in place to ensure that buildings
constructed are safe.
In situations where schools are attacked, communities may also establish temporary learning spaces.
In the Central African Republic (CAR), amid ongoing
violence and insecurity, communities set up ‘bush
schools’253 in makeshift shelters or under trees to
continue education when fighting forced them to flee.
Teachers received training and then worked for in-kind
payment from the community.254
With temporary learning spaces or non-formal
education sites, it is vital to ensure that children’s
learning and qualifications are recognized in order to
facilitate integration into formal education or
vocational training.255 This requires that the stakeholders, including international organizations that are
often involved, advocate with the Ministry of
Education and other key decision-making bodies to
recognize adapted forms of schooling. Although CAR’s
bush schools were initially intended to be temporary,
the Ministry of Education eventually recognized them,
which allowed for students’ and teachers’ future
success in formal education.256

Monitoring and reporting mechanisms
School management committees, parent teacher
associations, community groups and children’s clubs
can monitor and report cases of attack, facilitating
analysis that informs prevention and response
actions, supports advocacy and increases accountability.
Communities, schools and governments can set up
independent monitoring systems. They can also
contribute alerts to the UN Monitoring and Reporting
Mechanism on children and armed conflict (MRM),
which records grave violations of children’s rights in
certain conflict-affected countries. Ideally, local organizations should be involved in monitoring from the
outset to ensure that data collection is sensitive to
protection issues. In parts of eastern DRC, focal points
from school management committees and parent
teacher associations report violations of children’s
rights and children’s clubs are encouraged to participate.257 In the Philippines, it was found that the
creation and ongoing presence of a volunteer-run
community monitoring group (not initially linked with

85

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

the MRM) reduced attacks because armed non-state
actors were aware of permanent observation.258

options for community engagement prior to implementing programmes.

Reports from DRC and Nepal indicate that communitybased NGOs involved in the MRM have been
threatened and intimidated.259 Close communication
with community groups and regular evaluation and
adaptation of monitoring mechanisms according to
community feedback are important for improving data
collection and reducing the risks to locally-appointed
MRM Monitors.260

1. Community-initiated: Community members
conceive, define, manage, implement and resource
these initiatives. Continuing community motivation is
essential to maintain action.

Overview of community action to prevent
and respond to attack
To ensure suitable response strategies, stakeholders
should conduct an in-depth analysis of the nature of
attacks on education, community awareness and
attitudes to education, and existing community
action. Context is very important. For example, in
places like Nepal, where Maoists used schools to gain
support, community negotiation and pressure from
civil society and international actors on government,
political leaders or armed groups may protect
education. In other circumstances, such as in Liberia
and Côte d’Ivoire, physical strengthening of premises
or use of guards may be more appropriate.

Levels of community engagement
As noted above, community actions to protect
education from attack can be mapped using a
framework of four interconnected - and in some
instances overlapping - levels of community
engagement: community-initiated, community-implemented, community-inspired and communityinvolved. Which level is most effective may depend on
the resourcing and design of the protection activities
and on-the-ground realities. Additionally, interventions may start off being ‘community-initiated’,
and then be emulated by external actors who
introduce them into other communities where they
become ‘community-involved’ actions. Furthermore,
within one community or programme it is possible that
several different actions are carried out with differing
levels of engagement. The typology may help
programme planners when considering various

86

CASE EXAMPLE: In the eastern part of Myanmar,
conflict between armed non-state actors and state
armed forces resulted in burning of schools, forced
relocation, and abduction and recruitment of children
on their way to school. Because strict government
controls blocked international access to conflictaffected areas, communities responded entirely
alone. They frequently rebuilt schools or provided
education in temporary facilities during displacement.
Local organizations monitored the incidence of
attacks and conducted advocacy. These efforts were
initiated and maintained without external support.261
2. Community-implemented: Groups external to the
community design these interventions but rely on
community members to manage, support or resource
activities. The assumption is that community volunteerism will maintain actions beyond the life of the
project when external funding ends.
CASE EXAMPLES: School management committees in
DRC variously initiated by UN agencies, NGOs and the
Ministry of Education fall into this category. In
Afghanistan, community guards, initially supported by
the government, became the responsibility of communities themselves in many locations.
3. Community-inspired: Community groups conceive
or develop these actions but rely upon some form of
external support (human resources, skills, knowledge,
advocacy or funding).
CASE EXAMPLE: Malala Yousafzai’s campaign for girls’
education may be seen as ‘community-inspired’
action. She and the community in which she lived may
not have been able to raise the same level of
awareness without collaboration with international
media and UN agencies.
4. Community-involved: In these activities, external
organizations, donors or governments use participatory processes to solicit community perspectives to
shape the design, monitoring and evaluation of the

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

programme, but implementation is not in the
community’s hands. Actions continue as long as the
external funding stream is available. This often occurs
in rapid onset emergencies, when international
agencies have access to the affected population and
support education as a short-term gap-filling
measure.
CASE EXAMPLE: During the post-election violence in
Côte d’Ivoire in 2011, armed groups attacked large
numbers of villages, causing forced displacement,
and used schools. In response, NGOs set up
temporary learning spaces in camp settings.262 The
speed at which programmes providing temporary
learning spaces are established may limit the level of
community participation in programme design, but
NGOs do solicit community perspectives in the
monitoring process. When camps close down, the
programme may move with the population or close if
formal education has been reinstated. The role of the
community would become critical at this stage.

Overview of community engagement
Many of the forms of education protection cited earlier
can be implemented at any of the four different levels
within this typology – with some exceptions. Different
forms of support may be more or less realistic or
effective depending on the context, the nature of
attacks and community views of education.
Programme initiatives within a country may span the
full range of levels of engagement, depending on sitespecific realities. While community-initiated activities
may be better adapted to context and considered
more cost-effective than community-involved ones,
they are not feasible in all contexts. Furthermore,
some initially community-organized actions, such as
protests, may only achieve large-scale outcomes once
they gain support from NGOs, UN agencies or the
media.

Case studies of community prevention
and response action
Two country case studies, on the Philippines and
Afghanistan, are presented here to demonstrate the
range of activities in which communities can engage
within a given context. They also show how national

and international actors may support communities to
achieve protection for education.

The Philippines: Zones of Peace, and
monitoring and reporting
For the past thirty years, Mindanao, in the southern
Philippines, has experienced conflict between
government forces and a range of non-state actors.
Fighting between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) and the government alone has cost 60,000
lives and driven a million people from their homes.263
These conflicts have been accompanied by recurrent
attacks on education throughout Mindanao, including
burning and occupation of school buildings,
kidnapping of teachers,planting of explosive devices,
forced evacuations and physical attacks on school
buildings during fighting.In some cases, teachers
were targeted while performing election duties. The
MRM taskforce identified both state forces and armed
non-state groups as perpetrators.264

Initiatives engaging community groups in protection
of education
Learning Institutions as Zones of Peace
The Learning Institutions as Zones of Peace (LIZOP)
programme started in 2011, influenced by previous
national and international initiatives in zones of
peace, and established spaces that care for the
welfare of all children, prioritizing their rights to
protection and education.265 UNICEF is supporting the
expansion of this programme in conflict-affected
areas in Mindanao in collaboration with several NGOs,
the Department of Education and community groups.
The objective is to engage stakeholders – community
leaders, parents, teachers, state agencies and parties
to the conflict – to enable children in conflict-affected
areas to access safe education. Stakeholders in four
pilot communities participated in a process of developing a ‘declaration’ to recognize schools as ‘Zones of
Peace’.266 The project is now being rolled out in eight
additional communities.
Monitoring and reporting mechanisms
The Mindanao Peoples Caucus (MPC), formed in
January 2003, has trained 3,500 local volunteers,
called the Bantay Ceasefire group, to monitor and

87

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

report violations of the ceasefire agreement between
the MILF and the government, including attacks on
schools.267 The Bantay Ceasefire group has shared
information and reports of child rights violations with
the UN MRM in place in the Philippines since 2007.
Awareness-raising
In addition, the MPC runs the Youth Volunteers for
Peace Action Network. They seek to generate support
for the peace process among youth through advocacy
campaigns.268 UN agencies and NGOs also engage
communities in a process of awareness-raising on
existing legislation.

National and international support for community action
These community actions and the LIZOP process build
upon, and are underpinned by, government legislation
to protect education. Key legislation supports
education for all, prohibits the military use of schools
and promotes protection of children in conflict.269

Reported outcomes
The village of Tina, in the province of Maguindanao in
Mindanao, has shown positive results of community
and agency efforts. As of 2008, conflict forced the
entire population to evacuate the village, resulting in
its occupation by the MILF. In late 2010, when the
community started to return, UNICEF began working
with the community and other key stakeholders to
implement the LIZOP model enabling Tina Primary
School to reopen with 104 pupils in 2011. Members of
the armed forces and the MILF all decided that they
would not carry firearms in the vicinity of the school
and other learning spaces and agreed not to allow
their own children to carry firearms at school.270
The Bantay Ceasefire group is also perceived to have
made parties to conflict more cautious because they
know a civilian-led monitoring team is reporting on
their actions.271

Key lessons learned
Although external actors are initiating and rolling out
LIZOP, the model borrows heavily from the two
decades-old Philippine practice of establishing
community-wide zones of peace.272 Research on zones
of peace initiatives has found that the process of
establishing community-wide peace agreements was

88

most successful and sustainable when engaging a
range of stakeholders – including government, local
and international organizations, church groups273 and
the community.274 Community engagement in
monitoring compliance with peace agreements
enabled permanent surveillance with low resource
investment. Further, it proved helpful to engage with
parties to the conflict as parents, rather than as armed
individuals. Overall, it may be seen that, out of the
four approaches outlined in the typology of
community engagement, only ‘communityinvolvement’ appears absent or insignificant in the
Philippines context.

Afghanistan: Negotiation and adaptation
Education was a point of contention in Afghanistan’s
conflicts long before the Taliban.275 Since the change
of government in 2001, schools have experienced
violent attacks,276 including arson, explosions and
grenades, as well as threats to teachers and the killing
and injury of students, teachers and other education
personnel. While the common depiction in the media
was that a majority of incidents emanated from
Taliban opposition to girls’ education, the reasons
were more complex. These additionally included
schools’ symbolic value as government entities, their
association with international military forces,
ideological opposition to any education offered
outside of madrassas (Islamic schools), local disputes
or ethnic rivalries, and opposition to the central
government and the rule of law by criminal groups.277

Initiatives engaging community groups in protection
of education
Communities in Afghanistan help manage and protect
schools278 through negotiation, physical strengthening, guards and adaptation of education delivery.
Some examples of community action are outlined
below.
School management committees, school protection
committees, school security shuras and community
protection shuras – defence groups focused either on
schools or the community as a whole – and parent
teacher associations were established, covering over
8,000 schools by 2009279 with support from NGOs, UN
agencies and the MoE. While the arrangements are

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

different, a common thread is participation of
community members to support education. To protect
education, these groups may: involve religious
leaders in reviewing or modifying school curricula;
improve governance; or establish lines of communication with potential attackers for purposes of
negotiation.
Government, NGOs and UN agencies have supported
and rolled out schools located inside communities.280
This may reduce the likelihood of attacks on children,
teachers or physical spaces by reducing distance to
school, attracting less attention and making it harder
for intruders to approach unnoticed. The schools also
tend to have stronger ties with their respective
communities which, in turn, work harder to protect
them.281
Communities also provide night guards for their
schools to prevent attack. School guards or whole
communities have put out fires caused by arson
attacks, reducing damage and enabling education
activities to resume more quickly.

National and international support for community action
Local-level community successes in negotiation must
be assessed against a backdrop of national-level
action. Attacks on students, teachers and school
buildings are criminal offences under Afghan law.282
The Ministry of Education has sought to prevent
attacks and reopen schools closed due to conflict,
including through negotiation with local-level Taliban
leaders on ways to adapt education to make it more
acceptable to all parties. In March 2009, following
these government initiatives, 161 schools re-opened
compared to 35 in 2007-2008.283 Between late 2010
and early 2011, negotiations between the Ministry of
Education and top-level Taliban leaders started, while
local-level negotiations also accelerated.284 The
number of schools re-opening grew while the number
of attacks dropped substantially in the second half of
2010 and even more so in 2011285 However, the
following year, the discussions stalled and the trend of
re-opening schools was partially reversed, even
though the Ministry of Education continued to report
overall progress in terms of decreasing violence and
increased re-opening of schools.286

Similarly, the success of adapting education delivery
at a local level must in part be attributed to central
ministry-level support and the resourcing and
promotion of this approach by international NGOs
such as Save the Children, CARE and Catholic Relief
Services.287

Reported outcomes
A number of successful site-specific processes of
negotiation between the Taliban and education
committees or village elders have led to the release of
teachers and the re-opening of schools.288 In some
cases, local communities agreed to adaptation, such
as curriculum changes or the hiring of Talibanapproved religious teachers.289 A randomized
controlled trial study of community schools in Ghor
province found that these schools have increased
access, completion rates and learning outcomes and
addressed gender constraints.290
However, according to field research by CARE in 2009,
only 4 per cent of respondents indicated that attacks
had been prevented in the past. Although this figure is
very low, communities believe their involvement in
prevention and response is important.291 The lack of
statistical proof of impact of community efforts may
reflect the difficulty of measuring prevention
(compared with response actions) and the challenges
in monitoring and reporting attacks in general, rather
than indicate that community engagement has limited
outcomes.

Key lessons learned
The majority of communities that CARE was able to
survey in its 2009 study felt that responsibility for
decision-making and implementation of mechanisms
to protect education from attack must remain local.292
Respondents believed that communities may play
numerous roles based on the type of attack and perpetrators responsible. For example, respondents
reported that, when attacks were linked to armed
conflict as opposed to criminal activity, the community
was more likely to know the attackers or be better able
to open a line of communication with them.293 Popular
opinion also appeared to play a role. An Afghanistan
Analysts Network report suggests that the Taliban
were aware of the need to interact positively with local

89

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

communities and therefore may have been more
responsive to their efforts to re-open or protect
schools.294
As a result of these factors some communities were
able to more effectively engage in actions like negotiating curriculum, undertaking dialogue with armed
groups or hiring local staff.295 Engaging communities
to negotiate for girls’ education may prove more
difficult in some situations, however, if perpetrators of
attacks on girls’ schools come from within the
community or have support there, which the CARE
study found sometimes to be the case.296 This
suggests it may be important to take into account
potential opposition to girls’ education within the
community when considering negotiation as a
protection measure.
Community members reported to CARE that they were
less likely to know or be able to negotiate with criminal
or outsider perpetrators. In these cases, activities like
investing in physical security, hiring guards and
increasing school patrols may be more appropriate.297
The CARE study also found that schools may be less
targeted where the community itself requested the
school or was deeply involved before establishing the
school.298 The association of schools with certain
international donors or military forces may place
schools at increased risk in the specific context of
Afghanistan.299
Evidence from Afghanistan shows that community
engagement must be tailored to each locale in order to
protect education most effectively. Therefore, the flexibility of programme strategies, objectives and
implementation plans is critical. Overall, the
‘community-involved’ type of approach appears to
hold little, if any, sway in the Afghan context, while
complex and site-specific permutations of the other
three approaches are evident.

Challenges of working with
community groups
The advantages of working with communities may
include: lower costs, ensuring actions taken are
tailored to context, achieving sustainability and
gaining credibility with parties to the conflict.

90

However, there are also a number of challenges,
including the following:
• Donor funding in conflict settings tends to be
short-term, seeking quick impact. This is often
incompatible with the long-term relationshipbuilding that working with communities often
requires.
• Variation in the composition of communities
means that one model of response might not fit
all contexts.
• Communities are not internally homogeneous.
Wider buy-in depends on working with a full
range of community members. However, there
may be language barriers between group
members or power dynamics that may slow
down activity implementation. Conversely,
more homogeneous communities may be less
likely to recognize the value of improved
relations since they interact less frequently with
members of the ‘other’ group. Therefore, they
may be less willing to collaborate with other
communities or minority groups.300
• Ethnic or religious divisions between agency or
government staff and community-level groups
may reflect the divisions that are at the heart of
the conflict.
• Language barriers may exist between international and national staff and the community
groups they are working with, especially in
more isolated communities. Furthermore,
literacy rates in many countries affected by
conflict tend to be low, particularly in remote
and hard-to-reach locations. This may limit
both physical and written outreach.301
• Relying on community volunteerism may mean
that initial programme costs are low. However,
this is not always sustainable. Over time, it may
lead to reduced community support, increased
costs or a halt in activities.302
• Community engagement may also transfer both
the responsibility for, and risk of, protecting
schools and providing security from state
actors to communities themselves. This may be
necessary in a conflict situation where the state

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

has been weakened and is unable to provide
security for its citizens in vast geographical
areas within its territory or because the state
may be a perpetrator of violence affecting
communities. However, care should be taken to
ensure that the community having sole responsibility for protecting education is viewed only
as a short-term, gap-filling strategy. Ideally, the
state should be responsible for providing
security and protection to its citizens.
• Community engagement may be difficult where
certain communities or groups oppose specific
aspects of education.
Only by recognizing and addressing these challenges
can programme collaborations with communities be
successful. Programming must be adaptable and
solutions must be found jointly with community
members.

Conclusion and recommendations
Evidence exists that communities participate in a
broad variety of protective actions ranging from
prevention to response. Most protective action can be
implemented with communities at any of the four
levels of engagement – community-initiated,
community-implemented, community-inspired and
community-involved. Each has value depending on
the setting-specific needs. For example, external
actors often support and advise the establishment of
Zones of Peace or school management committees. In
other situations, communities themselves have
appointed unarmed guards or altered education
delivery mechanisms. And it may be inappropriate and
risky for external actors to initiate some activities,
such as protest and one-to-one negotiation with
armed non-state actors.
Before developing policies or programmes, external
actors, in collaboration with the communities they
seek to assist, should carry out in-depth analysis of
the nature of attacks on education, an assessment of
community attitudes to education and a mapping of
existing community action. These may inform their
decisions on how best to engage different communities.

Governments, donors, NGOs and UN agencies
typically assume that it is beneficial to engage
communities in protecting education. However, there
is very limited quantitative or qualitative data on the
impact of these actions. Further research should
explore the advantages and disadvantages of
community action and assess what forms of action
achieve the greatest impact while minimizing physical
risks or negative impacts on education quality.
While there are significant advantages to working with
communities, there are also challenges. These include
a possible lack of awareness of the value of education,
low literacy levels and intra-community tensions that
may hamper actions to protect education from attack.
Strong participatory monitoring systems need to be in
place to identify these issues early and mitigate any
negative effects on programming.
Finally, while community engagement has value, it is
also important not to forget that the state is the
ultimate duty-bearer with regards to education and
the protection of citizens. All programmes should seek
to support governments to implement durable
protective mechanisms once the context enables
them to do so.

Recommendations
For governments
• Encourage and invest in the development of
community-based mechanisms to protect
education. Incorporate these into education
sector plans and ensure that they are in line
with national policies and standards. These
may include: school management committees,
contingency plans, education awareness
campaigns, etc.
• Coordinate external actions and provide recognition for agreed alternative forms of education
that are common and reportedly effective
measures for protecting education in certain
settings such as community-based schools and
temporary learning spaces.
• Where appropriate, conduct a conflict risk
assessment to ensure that activities do not
heighten risk to education.

91

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

For institutional donors
• Increase the flexibility of funding streams
(including the time horizon for implementation)
in order to be able to better tailor programmes
to the context of specific communities and
types of attacks on education, and to facilitate
community engagement and ownership.
• Apply more nuanced conditionality to funding
streams. Conditions that restrict contact
between grant recipients and particular actors
that may perpetrate attacks on education can
inhibit certain protective measures, such as
undertaking or facilitating negotiations with
armed groups or military forces.

For UN agencies and NGOs
• With engagement from communities, conduct a
context and conflict analysis to inform
response design, including:
— assessment of the nature of attacks on
education in relation to the history of the
conflict;
— consideration of whether external assistance can increase the risk that education
may be attacked;
— analysis of community power structures,
knowledge, attitudes and practices that
may exacerbate threats to education or
affect programme implementation; and
— mapping community actions to protect
education.
• Carefully consider the role of the national
government in community protection projects
with attention to conflict dynamics, since, in
some situations, government involvement can
heighten the risk of attack or governments
themselves may be perpetrators. Where appropriate, elicit government participation in
project development, planning and implementation.

92

• Based on the initial mapping, determine the
appropriate level of community engagement in
all phases of project development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Use varied
methods to engage all community members,
including those from marginalized groups, so
as not to exacerbate any existing tensions.
• Ensure that staff have the relevant cultural
knowledge and background and are accepted
as neutral parties.
• Consider long-term sustainability to ensure that
risk to education does not return once the
programme ends. Long-term programming,
with due consideration for sustainability, is
vital when seeking community engagement in
activities. For interventions like community
schools, this may include lobbying the relevant
line ministries to support the training of paraprofessionals, integrate them into the formal
system, endorse the curricula and strengthen
facilities.

social cohesion. Consequently, such attacks must be
challenged with greater rigour and resources.

Protecting higher education
from attack

For the purpose of this essay, an attack on higher
education, as with attacks on other levels of
education, is defined as any threat or deliberate use of
force, carried out for political, military, ideological,
sectarian, ethnic or religious reasons, against higher
education institutions, administrators, academic and
other staff, or students. These include acts of intentional violence resulting in damage or destruction of
institutions or facilities, or physical harm or death to
individuals. They also include deliberate acts of
coercion, intimidation or threats of physical force that
create a climate of fear and repression that undermines academic freedom and educational functions.
The definition, however, does not include non-violent
infringement of academic freedom or discrimination in
hiring, promotion or admission.303

While there is a growing body of work investigating the scale, nature and impact of attacks
on children and schools, far less attention has
been placed on attacks on higher education,
and still less on the protection and prevention
measures that are being or could be taken. The
lack of research and the limited attention given
to developing and implementing such measures
represent a serious omission on the part of the
international community, as the higher
education sector has a vital role to play not only
in scientific progress but in political, economic,
social and cultural progress too, including in
the development and provision of primary and
secondary education. This chapter explores why
attacks on higher education occur and how they
might be prevented or their impact reduced. A
starting point would be to invest in evidencegathering and advocacy aimed at increasing
accountability, as well as in strengthening
emergency protection and prevention measures
Higher education is a public good. The university
sector throughout the world has a complex and multifaceted role in developing human capital vital for
scientific, political, economic, social and cultural
progress. This includes developing pedagogy and
providing future teachers for schools; acting as a point
of critical reflection on national development;
preparing young adults to become active citizens and
future leaders; and offering a potentially autonomous
space, independent of state, capital, religion and
society, where key issues can be debated and
solutions developed through evidence-based
discourse. Attacks on this sector amount to attacks on
all levels of education, as well as on intellectual,
cultural and economic heritage, political stability and

Attacks on higher education communities have been
documented in armed conflicts, but many also occur
under repressive regimes where armed conflict may
not be present.304 Indeed, some of the most damaging
attacks on higher education happen in situations
where universities and their academics and students
are perceived by repressive authorities as a ‘threat’ in
a way that schools, teachers and pupils typically are
not. As a result, they may be at heightened risk of
individual attacks or campaigns comprising multiple
attacks over an extended period, whether aimed at the
isolation and persecution of a single target or the
intimidation of the higher education community as a
whole.
In this essay, we look at why attacks on higher
education occur and the impact of such attacks before
considering how they might be deterred or prevented
and how, once they occur, they might be addressed.
The chapter concludes with a brief synopsis of the core
arguments and their implications, highlighting
knowledge gaps and pointing towards areas for future
research and policy development.

Motives for attacks on higher education
The motives for attacks on higher education are
multiple and they vary within and across contexts.
Academics and higher education students can be

93

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

both supporters of, and threats to, the power and
legitimacy of state and non-state actors. Thus they can
be targeted for a number of reasons, falling under
three main categories, each of which is broadly
‘political’ in character:
• The subject and nature of teaching, research,
writing and publication;

education system, wherein higher education institutions and personnel develop instructional methods
and content, and train teachers, administrators and
other education professionals. Furthermore, they may
adversely impact the wider society, curtailing the
contributions of higher education to the development
of human capital and knowledge that foster economic
and social progress.

• Identity, religious, sectarian and gender issues;
• Factors relating to armed conflict or high levels
of violence or coercion in society (including, in
the context of an armed conflict, strategic and
tactical considerations related to destroying
state symbols and defeating the enemy;
proximity of university campuses to
government buildings; a desire to convert
university facilities to military use; terrorism,
insurgency or counter-insurgency strategies;
weakening of the state and the rule of law; and
the militarization of opposition groups).
Any particular attack may involve more than one
motive within one or more of these categories,
especially where multiple perpetrators or targets may
be involved.

Impact of attacks on higher education
Attacks on universities, students and academics may
constitute violations of the right to education and
other human rights, including freedom of expression.
The most serious attacks on higher education are
those that violate the right to life and the personal
liberties of members of the higher education
community, including abduction, disappearance,
torture, extra-judicial killing, indirectly induced or
forced exile, arbitrary arrest, detention without trial,
trial and arbitrary imprisonment, threats and
harassment.305 Apart from their grave consequences
for the individuals directly targeted and their families,
these attacks can undermine local research and
teaching by triggering self-censorship, retreat, fear
and flight or ‘brain drain’306 that can silence a whole
academic community.307 They may also have a serious
impact on wider issues of access to, and quality of,
education at all levels, in both the short and long term,
given the interdependence of the different levels of an

94

How can attacks on higher education
be prevented?
UN agencies, national and international civil society
organizations and national governments have
developed measures to protect education in situations of fragility, violence, repression, humanitarian
emergency and armed conflict.308 These range from
local initiatives to governmental and transnational
projects and reforms, and aim variously at protecting
civilian lives and education infrastructures, promoting
the right to education and academic freedom, and
preventing attacks from taking place. A 2011 GCPEA
study categorizes such measures as falling under four
groups: 1) protection; 2) prevention; 3) advocacy; and
4) monitoring.309 The focus of the study, and of the
majority of measures developed to date, has been on
situations affecting primary and secondary education,
but it may be possible to apply these to the protection
of higher education, while keeping in mind that many
attacks on higher education occur outside of conflict
situations and may therefore warrant specific
responses tailored to the sector.
Measures to protect higher education should focus on
increasing protection, prevention and accountability
through greater application of existing domestic and
international laws, and enhanced monitoring,
reporting, and domestic and international advocacy.

Protection and prevention measures
Restricting military use of university facilities
In countries such as Côte d’Ivoire,310 Somalia311 and
Yemen,312 state forces or armed non-state groups have
used universities for military purposes such as
weapons caches, strategic bases or training camps.
This increases the risk that attacks aimed at such
forces or groups might result in intentional or

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

collateral damage to facilities; and, if the university
continues to function despite being used for military
purposes, it increases the risk of harm to members of
higher education communities.313 This also undermines the autonomy of higher education institutions
and risks creating a perception that the institution and
its personnel are aligned with combatants, increasing
their vulnerability (discussed below). Protection
against such military use of universities and other
educational buildings is extensively covered later in
this report in the essay: ‘Military use of schools and
universities: changing behaviour’.314

Strengthening university autonomy
While there is extensive literature on the topic of
university autonomy, it is not often linked explicitly to
the issue of security from violent or coercive attacks.
However, recent work commissioned by GCPEA315
examines the relationship between autonomy and
security, and reflects on the security-enhancing
potential of university autonomy around the world.
The work lays out some of the ways in which
enhancing university autonomy vis-à-vis the state can
provide a possible model for reducing attacks on
higher education systems, particularly when coupled
with university-controlled internal security provision.
These ideas include developing and extending the
notion of the university as a space outside direct state
control (even when funding is largely state-provided),
including control of recruitment, financial and administrative management, curriculum and freedom of
research. It also extends to the prohibition of state
forces entering university campuses (unless invited in
by the institutional leadership or in extremely rare
circumstances). The authors argue that: ‘The ultimate
goal of all of these efforts should be to establish a
culture of autonomy and security, recognized not only
within the higher education sector but in the wider
society, in which higher education spaces are “off
limits” to attacks, freeing them to develop their
research and educational functions to their fullest and
to the maximum benefit of all.’316
The case of Colombia provides an illustrative example.
In response to campus demonstrations against higher
education reforms, successive Colombian governments have challenged the autonomy of university

space, arguing that the state has the right to intervene
in all national territory to protect its citizens. Similarly,
they have argued that armed non-state actors, particularly the guerrilla movements, are using the university
as a space for recruitment and incitement.317 Many
infringements of higher education space have
occurred over the past two decades, resulting in
violent clashes between students and state forces and
the deaths of several students.318
The authors of the GCPEA study note that to have full
protective effect, a culture of respect for institutional
autonomy must include not only the state but also
non-state actors and the academic community itself.
In Colombia, this broad culture has been undermined
by decades of violence, leaving the Colombian
academic community vulnerable to threats and
attacks by illegal paramilitary forces and their
successor groups, such as the Black Eagles.319
Meanwhile, the state, which has failed to provide
universities with full security from such attacks,
responds to them by limiting the universities’
autonomy. As the study notes, full respect for
autonomy requires more than the state refraining from
committing attacks. States also have a responsibility
to protect higher education communities from attack –
especially from para-state forces, insurgencies or
criminal gangs which are less likely to be subject to
the same pressures as states to comply with legal
norms and policies – but in ways that respect and
promote autonomy.

Physical protection of higher education
Increasing protection through defensive, physical
measures has been one of the traditional responses to
attacks on primary and secondary education, as cases
across a number of contexts show.320 Physical
protection strategies for higher education could
similarly include defensive reinforcement of infrastructure, such as installing bullet-proof windows and
blast-proof walls; installing security ramps and other
anti-suicide bombing measures (e.g. metal detectors,
security cameras and checkpoints);321 changing
lecture times to fit with arrival and departure in
daylight hours; escorting higher education professionals, students and education trade unionists en
route to and from university; and providing

95

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

bodyguards and blast-proof vehicles for high-profile
staff and trade unionists. These strategies could also
include providing armed or unarmed security forces
around or within universities, although these should
be provided in ways that recognize and enhance the
autonomy concerns unique to higher education,
whenever practical (see above).
There are a number of country-specific examples of
physical protection strategies involving university
campuses and communities. In Colombia, a Working
Group on the Human Rights of Teachers composed of
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
(OHCHR)322 and representatives from the Colombian
government and the trade union movement provided
threatened or targeted teachers, university academics
and trade union representatives with administrative
and financial support for protection measures. Special
committees were set up that studied on a case-bycase basis the type and degree of risk and the type of
ensuing protection, including armed escorts/guards,
mobile phones, bulletproof vehicles and temporary
relocation.323

academics often occur off-campus; second, attacks
that take place inside higher education buildings have
in some cases been carried out through suicide
attacks or using remotely detonated bombs, which
may make external security measures ineffective; and
third, security measures and armed responses risk
limiting or restraining the autonomy of universities,
especially when the perpetrator of aggression and
violence is the state through its security forces.325
Increasing use of university-controlled private security
guards might be a partial solution to these challenges,
at least as far as respecting autonomy concerns, but
not in all cases. Furthermore, even the best trained
private security forces will be of little use in situations
where the state itself is the source of the threat to
universities and to the perceived ‘enemies’ within
their walls.326

Promoting resilience: alternative sites and modes of
higher education provision
Flexible education provision has been tested in places
such as Belarus, Iraq, Israel/Palestine and Zimbabwe.
It implies reducing the risk of students and staff as
visible targets by removing them from the context of
traditional learning places, reducing the time they
spend in class by rescheduling lectures and providing
them with alternative learning modalities (e.g. homeschooling, community-based learning or distance
learning).

It is not clear to what extent the securitization and
militarization of educational staff and buildings may
mitigate or exacerbate attacks, and if, and in which
ways, such measures may affect learning. While a high
risk of attacks may necessitate increasing security at
and around universities, physical protection
strategies present a number of dilemmas: first,
escorting large groups of students and university
professors collectively may render these groups and
the respective guards more exposed to attacks;
second, concentrating security forces around universities may turn students or scholars into individual
targets outside the university campus; third,
enhancing infrastructure security may protect
university buildings but equally it may turn them into
‘attractive’ locations for military use by armed forces;
fourth, there is a risk that the use of self-defensive
force by education staff could be seen or interpreted
as taking an active part in the hostilities, thus turning
them into potential targets.324

In 2007, a year rife with attacks on Iraqi academics and
scholars, the Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education
allowed academics and researchers to work from
home for part of the week in order to minimize
movement around university buildings.327 While
similar measures may prove efficient in reducing the
number of fatalities, they do little to reduce death
threats or to prevent the ensuing exodus. In this
regard, more can be done with exiled academics
either to find ways through which they can still
contribute to the national education system, or to
better integrate them in the new host country, giving
them the chance to continue their work throughout the
period abroad.

Moreover, effective implementation of such strategies
in the higher education context may be difficult for
several reasons: first, attacks on students and

For example, distance learning programmes have
been developed by a number of organizations,328
enabling exiled Iraqi scholars to record lectures that

96

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

are screened at universities within Iraq and to connect
in ‘real time’ with students and faculty at Iraqi universities,329 and fostering exchange between Iraqi
universities and universities abroad to improve access
and quality of higher education within Iraq.330 In
Israel/Palestine, distance learning has been used to
mitigate problems associated with university closures
and travel risks for students and academics at
Palestinian universities.331 In Zimbabwe, virtual classrooms have enabled academics in the diaspora as well
as non-Zimbabwean lecturers to deliver lectures in
areas such as health science and veterinary science to
students at the University of Zimbabwe.332 These are
fields of study in which there are staffing and teaching
capacity gaps at the university,333 as many higher
education staff have felt compelled to leave the
country.334
Other alternative sites or modes of education
provision include home schooling or communitybased learning. Following the removal of autonomy
and the repression by the Serbian state throughout
the 1990s and until the 1999 war, the education of
Kosovo Albanian children and youth was based on a
parallel schooling system that operated from the
primary to the tertiary level.335 As a political response
to increasing pressure placed by Belgrade on Kosovo
Albanian scholars and activists, the parallel ‘Albanian
University of Prishtina’ was reorganized into a
diaspora-funded system whose classes were offered
in the basements of private apartment buildings:336
such a political choice had protective implications.
There exists little comparative research on the topic of
flexible education, however, and there is little
substantive evidence on whether such a system could
work for urban-based higher education in larger
settings and in conflict areas.
Alternative learning programmes, when and where
implemented, also raise questions about the quality,
feasibility and sustainability of the education
provided as well as about relations with the formal
education system. With regard to higher education,
the lack of empirical research renders it unclear to
what extent and for how long such alternative learning
programmes can prove to be useful, how they can be
certified and what their overall impact is on the quality
of education.

Recovery measures for academics in exile: fellowships
and multiple relocations
Many of the international networks and organizations
that engage in advocacy on behalf of threatened
academics provide support for relocation to other
countries, including offering, finding or funding
temporary academic positions, as well as professional
capacity development programmes and research
fellowships.337 Clearly, much of this work provides a
vital lifeline for vulnerable and threatened academics.
But it also raises important issues related to brain
drain and the well-being of those academic communities left behind.
For any academic or scholar, the decision whether to
stay or leave is a very personal one. It reflects calculations about physical safety of the individual and her or
his family; about work prospects; and about the future
of the country in which she or he is working. The
decision to leave is rarely taken lightly, and it is often
not intended to be a ‘forever’ decision. However,
exiled academics may be more effective when safely
outside of their home countries, living in conditions
that allow them to produce academic works – and
often send them home – in a way that would otherwise
not have been possible under conditions of attack and
life-threatening insecurity.
Reversing brain drain is not impossible and a multifaceted response towards ending impunity and
increasing resources and protection for higher
education personnel would, in many cases, further
promote returns. More specifically, the risk of brain
drain could be reduced by: increasing support and
protection measures for scholars and academics
before they feel compelled to flee the country; developing particular programmes that would ease and
support their eventual reintegration while still in exile
and after they return to their home country; facilitating
increased security provision; and increasing support
from colleagues in the region and beyond to prevent
feelings of isolation.

Underground and in-exile universities
One of the few cases of entire universities relocated in
exile is the European Humanities University (EHU) in
Belarus338 which, following government efforts to
assert control over the university, relocated to

97

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

Lithuania with support from over a dozen governments, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs,
foundations, corporations and individuals.339 Many of
the staff and students still live in Belarus and endure
regular harassment from the Belarus authorities when
travelling between university and home. A similar
example was the establishment in Syria of the private
International University for Science and Technology in
2005.340 The institution was founded by a group of
Iraqi professors who, having fled Iraq following
targeted assassinations of academics, pooled their
savings, opened the first English-language university
(with both Iraqi and Syrian students enrolled) and
recruited other Iraqi professors from Iraq.341 The
university was still operational in 2013, although it had
had to adapt to conditions of insecurity resulting from
the Syrian conflict.342
A further example of alternative, though widely
known, higher education provision is the Baha’i
Institute for Higher Education (BIHE) in Iran. It was
founded in 1987 as a result of systematic discrimination and exclusion from universities of the religious
minority group Baha’i.343 Characterized by an
innovative teaching-learning environment, courses
that were initially delivered by correspondence are
now provided through on-line communication
technologies. In addition to the on-line platform, an
affiliated global faculty that involves hundreds of
accredited professors from universities outside Iran
assists BIHE as researchers, teachers and
consultants.344 However, in 2012 the Special
Rapporteur on Iran reported that in June 2011 the
Ministry of Science and Technology had declared the
activities of the institute illegal and that all diplomas
and degrees issued by it had no legal validity; and
noted that some individuals affiliated to the university
had since been arrested.345

Community protection
Mechanisms of protecting education from attack
based on community engagement have been tested in
rural settings and for primary and secondary
education, while to date there have been no examples
of their effectiveness for higher education. For higher
education institutions and academic communities,
mainly located in urban areas, the potential of using

98

local community leaders and links to offer protection
is much weaker. Local people may not identify with a
university, which likely draws its student population
from a wide area, in the same way that they do with the
schools their own children attend.
Furthermore, community-based protection often
implies negotiation and bargaining with religious
leaders or ideology-driven armed groups. But such
people may not see higher education students and
academics – who are often viewed as sources of
power or threats to power – as ‘neutral’ in the way that
younger schoolchildren and their teachers are
generally perceived. Negotiating security would
therefore probably require a much greater degree of
trade-off and compromise, which might in turn be
detrimental to academic freedom or the rights of
specific groups within the university, such as female
students. Moreover, community-based measures are
likely to offer little protection against violence or
coercion by the institutions of the state itself.

Negotiated codes of conduct as protective/preventive
measures
Initiatives of negotiation to turn schools into safe
sanctuaries, such as the Schools as Zones of Peace
programme carried out in Nepal, have not yet been
applied to protecting higher education communities
from attack. It is thus not clear whether, to what extent
and how they would work at this level. The university,
unlike the school, is often a setting for intense
political debate. Higher education communities often
seek greater autonomy and academic freedom to
engage in teaching, research and debates on pressing
societal issues; consequently, they might be resistant
to strategies that could be perceived as requiring a
trade-off between unfettered academic activity and
security. At the same time, the rapid expansion of
international higher education partnerships and
exchanges, ranging from higher education ministries
to institutions and administrators, academics and
students, may create opportunities for negotiating
standards of behaviour, including increased
protection. Large, influential higher education
networks and associations in particular, with increasingly global memberships where participation and
good standing are prerequisites for international

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

recognition and prestige, may provide platforms for
norm-setting.346 Pilot studies, research and consultation with stakeholders are needed to better
understand under what conditions such participatory
processes might lead to agreements, codes of conduct
and the standards which strengthen the status of
universities as zones of peace.

Accountability measures
Reducing impunity for perpetrators of attacks on
higher education communities is essential to
providing justice to victims, deterring future attacks
and combating some of the most harmful negative
impacts of attacks on higher education, including selfcensorship, isolation, involuntary exile and brain
drain.
While non-state actors are often implicated in attacks,
states and state-entities bear primary responsibility
for protecting higher education communities. Yet too
often states and state-entities are themselves implicated in attacks on higher education communities,
directly or indirectly, or they fail to investigate
incidents and hold perpetrators accountable. UN
agencies, governments and international civil society
organizations, including both human rights organizations and international higher education networks
and associations, must do more to pressure states to
recognize and adhere to their responsibilities.
Campaigns aimed at raising awareness of attacks on
higher education should emphasize state action and
responsibilities and might include positive,
negotiated approaches to encouraging more effective
protection and prevention measures by states, as well
as more adversarial efforts to improve protection,
including highlighting state involvement, complicity
or failures to protect in reporting and inter-state
mechanisms and bringing formal legal complaints
under existing legal standards.
As to the latter, international humanitarian, human
rights and criminal law provides general rights and
protections which higher education and members of
higher education communities enjoy to the same
extent as other institutions and citizens, such as the
protection regarding the physical integrity of civilians
and infrastructure not used for military purposes, the

right to freedom of expression, and so forth.347 In
addition, certain international instruments offer
specific protections to higher education, including the
International Labour Organization (ILO) core
Conventions 87 and 98 on freedom of association and
the right to collective bargaining, and the UNESCO
Recommendation on the Status of Higher Education
Teaching Personnel defining autonomy and academic
freedom. Efforts should be made to encourage and
reinforce local and international legal practitioners in
using the laws at their disposal to advocate for the
protection of higher education communities and their
members.

Reporting and advocacy measures
Monitoring and reporting
Monitoring means the systematic collection and
analysis of information. Accurate information about
individual attacks or national patterns is crucial for
enhancing prevention and providing protection.
However, information is often lacking as to ‘who’ and
‘what’ is targeted, the reasons behind attacks, and the
effects and trends over time.348
Several actors have an explicit or implicit mandate to
monitor and respond to attacks on education.
Theoretically, governments are in the best position to
monitor attacks on higher education but this
monitoring is often inadequate and where state
security or armed forces are the perpetrator of attacks,
they may not be trusted or appropriate. Efforts at
collecting data should be complemented by the work
of police, prosecutors and criminal courts for investigating and prosecuting attacks that constitute
criminal violations under domestic and international
law. UN bodies can also play a monitoring role, while
international and local NGOs may help to fill the gaps
of UN monitoring systems or to compensate for the
lack of will or capacity of government authorities. The
UN and NGOs may have to take the lead where the
government is itself the source of the abuse.349
In Colombia, the Ombudsman’s office monitors
human rights situations in many areas, working as an
early warning system for preventing abuses. It has
played a pivotal role in reporting threats to, and
attacks on, communities, trade unionists and

99

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

teachers. However, government authorities have not
always taken into consideration or reacted through
protection measures to risk reports from the
Ombudsman’s office reporting human rights violations in the country.350 Elsewhere, government actions
can actually endanger higher education. In India,
government troops and paramilitary police have been
based in schools and on at least one college campus
as part of their counter-insurgency strategy against the
Naxalites, a practice that has increased the risk that
these facilities may be attacked or that students and
staff may be caught in the crossfire.351
More generally, governments may lack the capacity or
the will to monitor attacks on education. In particular,
this is often the case in conflict-affected areas.
Governments may not be operative in, exert control
over, or be in communication with many areas within
the country’s territory. In other cases, governments
may be implicated in the attacks, so they have an
interest in obstructing or diverting the whole process
of data monitoring and collection.
UN human rights mechanisms, such as the Human
Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and
its Special Procedures, treaty bodies, and fact-finding
missions and commissions of inquiry are well
positioned to monitor, report and hold states
accountable for their human rights violations related
to the higher education community. Through the UPR,
the human rights records of all UN member states are
reviewed, allowing for an opportunity to inject
attention to higher education through that process.
The Human Rights Committee and the Committee on
Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights are treaty bodies
that monitor a number of human rights obligations
relevant to the protection of higher education; more
information relating to any violations of these obligations should be presented to the treaty bodies.
Similarly, the joint ILO/UNESCO Committee of Experts
is charged with monitoring and promoting adherence
to the 1997 Recommendation on the Status of Higher
Education Teaching Personnel; the committee may
provide another avenue for presenting evidence of
state failure to protect higher education from attack.
UN fact-finding missions and commissions of inquiry
should also be encouraged to specifically investigate
violations of humanitarian law and human rights

100

committed against the higher education community.
For example, the first Report of the independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab
Republic,352 which investigated alleged violations of
human rights between March 2011 and November
2011, did not report on the raid by security forces on
the dormitories of students at Damascus University in
June 2011, when three students were killed, 21 injured
and 130 arrested after students refused to participate
in pro-government rallies.353 Similarly, in its later
report of 16 August 2012,354 the commission did not
report on a raid by security forces at Aleppo University
in May 2012, when four students were killed, 28
injured and 200 arrested.355
Other UN bodies that have mandates related to human
rights, education and conflict are in a good position to
monitor and report attacks on education. Several of
them are better positioned to monitor attacks on
primary and secondary levels of education, and thus
attacks on higher education are monitored less. To be
explored is whether such agencies as OHCHR, the
Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Protection
and Education Clusters, and the United Nations Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(UNOCHA) might contribute to efforts to promote and
improve assessment and monitoring of attacks on
higher education. The monitoring work of some of
these agencies is activated only to the extent that
attacks on higher education affect humanitarian
access, thus leaving large gaps in reporting. The UN
MRM has the most explicit mandate to monitor attacks
on education at the levels of schools, students and
teachers, but higher education is not within its
purview.
Local and international NGOs may play an important
role in monitoring and reporting attacks on higher
education, especially in those cases where
government or state-backed forces have been implicated in attacks. Scholars at Risk has recently
launched such an initiative to track and report on five
defined types of attacks on higher education communities and their members: improper travel restrictions;
retaliatory discharge or dismissal; wrongful detention;
wrongful prosecution; and killings, violence or disappearances. An ‘other’ category is used to track
incidents outside the defined categories which may

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

significantly impair academic freedom or the human
rights of members of higher education communities,
such as violent student unrest, systemic discrimination or intimidation, university closures, military
use of higher education facilities and direct attacks on
university facilities or materials.356 Dissemination of
monitoring data by email, a website and in periodic
reports will help raise awareness and support future
advocacy for greater protection.
Documenting and reporting attacks are important for
holding perpetrators accountable, prosecuting them
at different levels and deterring future attacks.
However, collecting data that seek to map and
document responsibility for attacks is far more
difficult than reporting attacks. Current monitoring
efforts reflect some progress but also significant gaps.

National and transnational advocacy campaigns
Linked to the need for monitoring and reporting
mechanisms is the crucial role that national and international civil society advocacy – as a mechanism of
reporting, accountability, protection and prevention –
can play in addressing the issue of attacks on higher
education and academic freedom, particularly if the
perpetrator is a national government in a ‘non-conflict’
situation, which is often the case in the higher
education sector. Transnational networks, linked
through a myriad of organizations such as Human
Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Education
International and activated by national civil society
and human rights organizations, can be – when
successfully mobilized and coordinated – a powerful
force for protection of higher education communities.
Letters of protest and ‘urgent actions’ sent to international organizations, solidarity networks, and
pressure on government embassies can raise the
international profile of violations, making them visible
and increasing the costs of politically-motivated
violence or coercion. All of this pressure relies on
national civil society and human rights organizations
providing regular and well-documented evidence
upon which campaigns can be based.

legitimated both domestically and internationally and
to be seen as accepted members of the international
community. This is reflected in the increase in state
signatories to human rights agreements over the past
four decades, which appear important not just on the
international stage but also for national public
consumption.357 Similar reputational pressures may
be an avenue for increasing protection for higher
education communities, insofar as the higher
education sector is highly reputation-sensitive:
academic personnel, students, institutions and
national systems are themselves increasingly
integrated, and eager to partner with international
counterparts who could be mobilized to demand
greater security, autonomy and accountability.
In research on transnational advocacy movements,
Keck and Sikkink358 talk about the ‘boomerang effect’
whereby channels for change are blocked at the
national level and processes of transnational
advocacy assist in mobilizing external actors to
pressure the state and therefore change its behaviour.
Such transnational civil society pressure appears to be
an important variable in encouraging human rights
compliance and this is where global civil society
activism has the potential to make a real difference.
This can provide a solid rationale for an international
advocacy strategy on higher education attacks. The
recent campaign to free Miguel Ángel Beltrán, the
Colombian sociologist, is an illustrative example. From
the time of his detention in May 2009 to his release in
June 2011, a powerful global campaign gathered
petitions signed by thousands of teachers and
academics and activists,359 and lobbied the
Colombian government and their own respective
national governments to raise Dr Beltrán’s case.360
One caveat concerning this mechanism of protection
is that its power rests on the need of the perpetrators
for legitimacy. Similar to respect for university
autonomy, such pressure is less likely to work on
armed non-state actors, unless they are at a stage
where they are seeking legitimacy, and even less so on
criminal gangs.

The effectiveness of this type of protection measure
relies on the perpetrator’s sensitivity and need to
maintain international respectability. This appears
intimately related to the need of nation states to be

Conclusions and ways forward
As the above analysis demonstrates, possible
measures for the protection of higher education and
prevention of future attacks are wide-ranging and
each has strengths and limitations. Success is likely to
be highly context-sensitive and case-specific. More
research is clearly needed to improve knowledge and
awareness and further develop strategies on this
issue. This review suggests the need for caution in
generalizing findings and positing global solutions,
particularly when so little rigorous research is
available that maps the dynamics of attacks on higher
education in relation to mechanisms of protection,
prevention and accountability.
Nevertheless, immediate short-term steps can be
taken to increase protection and help prevent future
attacks. These could include increased support for the
monitoring of attacks on higher education. Analysis of
the problem of attacks on higher education points to
the lack of systematic documentation, and an absence
of a mechanism that specifically and exclusively
monitors and reports on attacks (nature, scope,
motives, patterns, frequency) and of international and
national protection responses. One important aspect
of this would be to gather data on attacks on university
students more systematically. Such data are worryingly absent from what little documentation exists.
Students unions and their collective organizations,
unlike academic staff organizations, often lack the
institutional infrastructure and resources to gather
data on attacks on members of their community.
These efforts could also be linked to awareness and
advocacy campaigns on attacks against students, and
lend support for the setting up of protection measures
for targeted or at-risk students similar to those
available to at-risk academics (temporary exile
strategies, etc.).
Mechanisms could also be developed to improve
emergency protection measures available to higher
education institutions and communities. In countries
with a high prevalence of attacks on higher education
institutions, efforts could be undertaken to raise
security awareness among students, academics and
administrators and other staff, for example, through
training workshops, and to develop a tailored security

102

strategy. These could be developed as part of a
broader strategy of reducing overall violence that
would turn higher education communities into less
vulnerable or soft targets, while simultaneously recognizing the dilemmas of securitization/militarization,
especially when the state is the only or main perpetrator of attacks.
Lobbying and advocacy could also be fruitfully
targeted at national governments to emphasize their
responsibilities for protecting higher education from
attack and the potential legal sanctions if they fail to
do so. Linked to this, there is a need to increase
awareness and understanding of attacks on higher
education as part of the problem of attacks on
education more generally. While there have been great
strides made over recent years in raising awareness of
attacks on education around the world, evidence and
advocacy on the higher education sector have been
noticeably lagging.

Military use of schools
and universities:
changing behaviour
Research shows it is common for state military
forces and armed groups to use schools and
universities as bases, barracks, night shelters,
fighting positions and detention centres during
conflict, often with serious consequences. It
makes them a target for the enemy, it causes
damage and destruction of facilities, it can put
students, teachers and academics at risk from
incoming fire or soldiers’ misconduct and it can
deprive students of classes for long periods or
lead to their dropping out of education. How can
a change in military behaviour be achieved?
This chapter explores why an effective approach
to better protecting schools and universities
from military use is through the adoption and
implementation of international guidelines
In March 2010, Human Rights Watch researchers
visited a government elementary school for Muslim
children in the southern Thai village of Ban Klong
Chang. The Royal Thai Army Ranger force had been
using the grounds of the school for the previous two
years, occupying about half of the school playing field.
The paramilitary soldiers were armed with pistols and
military assault rifles. One of the children at the school
told the researchers that they were allowed to touch
the weapons but were not allowed to carry them.
Despite the apparently friendly atmosphere, with
soldiers playing with students, some of the students
expressed fears. They said they worried that the guns
might hurt them. They also said that they were
frightened because the presence of the soldiers
meant that they and their friends might be hurt if
fighting broke out between the Rangers and the
opposing forces.
Both the students and their parents were concerned
that the teachers were unable to do their jobs as

successfully as they would if the school was just being
used as a school. There was a strong awareness in the
small village community of the extent to which the
soldiers’ presence was adversely affecting the
children’s schooling. Some of the girls were worried
about the soldiers touching them and one of them
said she was not happy that the soldiers asked her if
she had an older sister. The possibility of sexual
harassment of the girls was a general fear for both
parents and students, and one mother expressed
concern that her daughter might become pregnant by
the soldiers. The Rangers brewed and drank an herbal
narcotic drink in the school and some of the students
had apparently tried it themselves. The games that
students played also became increasingly militarized.
Inevitably, given their concerns, some parents
removed their children from the school but attendance
at an alternative school required the children to travel
an extra hour each day. There was no general
opposition to the soldiers’ presence in the locality –
just a widely held feeling that they should not be using
the school and that their presence was having a bad
effect on education.361
As this single example illustrates, during armed
conflict there is the potential for considerable interaction between those delivering and receiving
education and those doing the fighting, be they
members of states’ armed forces or those belonging to
armed non-state groups. This chapter discusses the
various forms military use of schools and universities
can take and considers ways in which the behaviour of
military forces might be changed to reduce that use,
including through the development of international
guidelines. It describes the content of Draft Guidelines
developed last year under the auspices of GCPEA and
how these are being taken forward for adoption. It
concludes with a brief discussion of how different
states and armed non-state actors might choose to
implement them.
Military commanders or the leaders of armed nonstate groups may regard school buildings as ideal for
use as headquarters, barracks or stores for military
equipment. Schools often have fenced or walled
perimeters making security relatively straightforward.
During active hostilities, their buildings can be used
as defensive positions, as good locations from which

103

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

to launch attacks or as observation posts. Their use for
such purposes may have a profound impact on educational provision, even to the extent that it may result in
the destruction of essential educational infrastructure.
Some acts that might seem positive to a military
commander, such as deploying a fighting force to
provide much needed security for a school, may
actually have negative consequences; the presence of
fighters in or around a school may render it a legitimate target for opposing forces. The close proximity
of military forces guarding a school may actually
attract the very assault they are attempting to prevent.
Armed conflict is an enduring feature of the international system. It should be possible, however, to
mitigate its worst effects by modifying the behaviour
of the fighting forces of parties to conflict. Their
actions can have profoundly damaging effects and
there is a responsibility on all concerned to take
measures to mitigate these negative impacts. Action
of any sort to reduce the effects of armed conflict on
education should be accorded a high priority. It is
necessary, however, to be realistic and pragmatic
about what is possible in that regard.

The military use of schools and
universities today
The GCPEA report Lessons in War: Military Use of
Schools and Other Education Institutions during
Conflict (2012) reveals clear evidence of the use of
educational institutions by the forces of parties to
conflict in armed conflicts in at least 24 countries in
Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and South
America from 2005 to 2012.362 In all 24 of these
countries, state armed forces were among those using
schools and universities, non-state actors used
schools and universities in 17 of these countries, and
other international actors used schools and universities in at least five of these countries.363
The evidence, however, almost certainly underrepresents the extent of military use of schools and
universities. For instance, not all ‘conflicts’ were
included in Lessons in War. ‘Criminal insurgency’364
has frequently been excluded from legal definitions of

104

armed conflict because it is motivated by greed rather
than a political objective. Importantly, however,
International Humanitarian Law says nothing about
the motives driving rival forces – something acknowledged by the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC)365 – so criminal gangs may be engaged in a form
of armed conflict if the intensity of armed violence
reaches a threshold level, as it has done in Mexico, for
example.
There is also a degree of under-reporting of military
use of schools and universities. This is not always
deliberate and can be related to the difficulties of data
capture in conflict zones. Nevertheless, governments
have suppressed information.366 Community leaders
may also fail to report such use for fear of retribution.
In any case, it is clear that military use of education
institutions has disrupted education provision in
many regions affected by conflict.
This is a serious problem. Military use of educational
institutions occurs in most regions affected by armed
conflict and assumes several forms. For these
reasons, GCPEA initiated a project to mitigate the
worst effects of military use of schools and universities by setting new standards to guide parties to
armed conflict.
Lessons in War analysed the military use of schools
and universities, categorizing the use to which they
are routinely put. The following seven different
categories of military use were identified:367

Bases and barracks
Bases or barracks are set up in school or university
buildings and grounds to accommodate fighters for
the medium to long term, providing them with access
to such amenities as cooking spaces, washing facilities and lavatories. Examples include:
• Across India, government paramilitary police
occupied schools. In 2010, before forces began
complying with court orders to vacate schools,
approximately 130 schools were being used,
particularly in states most affected by the
Maoist insurgency – Bihar, Chhattisgarh and
Jharkhand – but also in the country’s northeast, in Tripura, Manipur, Nagaland and
Assam.368

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

• In Syria, schools have been used as barracks for
government forces with tanks at the school
gates and snipers posted on rooftops. Antigovernment forces have also used schools as
bases.369

Defensive and offensive positions or staging areas
Troops use school or university buildings as defensive
positions providing protection from enemy fire, observation posts, firing positions or locations from which
to direct attacks on opposing forces.
• During Ramadan in 2010, Al-Shabaab fighters
entered a school in Mogadishu and told the
students to stay in their classrooms. The
fighters set up a surface-to-air rocket launcher
and fired from inside the school compound at
territory held by the Somali government.
Government forces responded and one rocket
hit the school just as the students were finally
released, killing eight on their way home.370
• For six months in 2011, Yemeni government
forces occupied the Superior Institute for
Health Science, a school for pharmacists and
physicians’ assistants on high ground in the
city of Ta’izz. Dozens of troops occupied the
medical laboratory and the pharmacology
department, as well as the roof. A machine gun
was mounted on an armoured vehicle in the
yard and machine gun and mortar rounds were
fired from the school while classes were in
session.371

Weapons and ammunition storage
In order to hide or simply store weapons and
ammunition, armed forces and armed groups have
stockpiled weapons and ammunition in schools and
school grounds.
• In 2010, the Armed Forces of the Philippines
and their irregular auxiliary force (the Citizen
Armed Force Geographical Units) used
functioning public schools to store weapons
and ammunition.372
• During an international assessment in 2011 in
Côte d’Ivoire following the arrest of former
President Laurent Gbagbo and the cessation of

hostilities, three schools were found to contain
firearms and ammunition.373
• In 2012, the UN verified 36 incidents of schools
in Yemen being used for weapons storage,
sometimes resulting in their closure.374

Detention and interrogation centres
Armed forces and armed groups have converted
schools into sites of detention and interrogation.
Sometimes, classrooms are used temporarily to hold
or interrogate individuals, possibly in connection with
other military activities in or around the school.
• In Syria in 2011, government authorities established numerous temporary holding centres in
schools during massive detention campaigns
while anti-government demonstrations were
underway. While in the schools, some
detainees were subjected to torture during
interrogation.375
• The Israeli Defence Forces have used schools in
the West Bank for detention and interrogation
while arresting anyone in the community aged
between 17 and 50.376
• During the armed conflict in Libya in 2011,
schools were converted into improvised
detention centres. Tajura Primary School, for
example, became a prison for several hundred
combatants who fought in support of the
Gaddafi regime.377

Military training
Schools and universities make ideal locations for
military training, fitness programmes and weapons
training for new recruits.
• In 2011, anti-Gaddafi forces in Libya conducted
training in schools. Journalists documented at
least one instance of rebel leaders using a
secondary school to instruct soldiers in the use
of anti-aircraft guns.378
• During 2012, Islamist armed groups controlling
northern Mali trained new recruits, including
children, in both private and public schools as
well as in Koranic schools.379

105

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

• Children have reported receiving military
training in madrassas (Islamic schools) in the
border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan from
armed groups active in these areas.380

Illegal recruitment of child soldiers
Many non-state armed groups have taken advantage
of schools as locations where children gather, to
recruit them into their forces.
• In April 2012, mutineers under General Bosco
Ntaganda rounded up over 30 male students at
Mapendano secondary school, in Masisi
territory, DRC. The boys and young men were
tied up, taken to a military camp and inducted
into Ntaganda’s forces.381
• The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC) engaged in child recruitment campaigns
in schools. In September 2008, they entered a
school in the department of Cauca where 800
students were studying and invited the children
to join the group.382
• In Somalia, Al-Shabaab militants have systematically used schools as recruiting grounds.
They have regularly visited schools and forcibly
removed children from classrooms, often at
gunpoint. They have lined up students,
selected those they deem fit to serve as fighters
and suicide bombers, and taken them back to
their training camps.383

Temporary shelter
Armed forces and armed groups sometimes use
schools and university buildings as temporary shelter,
either from incoming attacks or simply for protection
from the elements.
• In Colombia, army helicopters occasionally use
school playing fields and playgrounds as
landing sites for the unloading of personnel
and weapons.384
• In July 2010, the Myanmar government’s armed
forces temporarily sheltered from the rain in a
school in the village of Tha Dah Der, in the
north-eastern Karen state. Local residents had
already fled the area and the soldiers had
burned most of the buildings in the village.

106

They also tried to burn down the school
buildings.385
• In South Ossetia, Georgia in 2008, a kindergarten teacher reported to Human Rights Watch
that volunteer militias had been hiding in her
kindergarten and that Georgian government
forces had attacked the building with
rockets.386
As the preceding analysis shows, educational facilities are used regularly by armed forces in various
ways. While temporary physical occupation is the
most widely reported form of military use, other overt
and indirect forms of use are common. There are
instances where schools and universities are being
used militarily and educationally at the same time; in
other circumstances, military use spells the end of all
educational activities. In either case, the effects of
military use on education functions are typically
adverse.
The negative consequences of military use are many
and various. Students and teachers come under fire
and are often exposed to physical injury and sexual
violence. Students drop out of school or are removed
by worried parents who are frightened about the risks
to which their children are exposed. School and
university buildings are damaged and destroyed –
both by attacks precipitated by their use and by the
actions of armed forces and groups using them – with
many being altered in some way to make them even
more suitable for military use. Course notes,
textbooks, classroom furniture and a great deal of
other educational material are damaged or lost.
Students, teachers and support staff may suffer
trauma when schools are attacked; merely the fear of
attack can undermine the feeling of security that is
necessary for a good teaching and learning
environment. Schools and universities that are used
by the military while carrying on their educational
function become overcrowded; there are consequential lower rates of enrolment; the quality of
education that is still delivered declines; and the
presence of soldiers can seriously undermine general
personal security, with girls and women being
especially vulnerable.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Provision of security for educational
institutions
Not all forms of military interaction with education are
motivated purely by military imperatives, nor are they
necessarily negative in their impact. Schools and
universities in conflict zones are in need of security
and protection. Their administrators and military
commanders may judge it necessary for military
personnel to guard them. Military commanders with a
specific mandate to protect civilians as part of a
humanitarian mission, for example, may well regard
school security as an essential mission objective.
Education institutions damaged in war may need
rebuilding and essential services may need to be
restored. Military units could be physically capable of
providing the sort of support necessary to maintain
the infrastructure vital for schools to operate effectively. Indeed, military personnel may be the only
source of such support during conflict and its
immediate aftermath.
There is, however, a fundamental dilemma to be
faced. Military personnel providing the support and
security necessary for a school to function could
compromise that school’s status and lead to it
becoming a target for opposing military forces. This
may be the case even when a military force is acting in
a conflict zone under a humanitarian mandate. The
provision of support by the military could have exactly
the opposite effect of that intended.
Whether military interaction with education is essentially for military purposes or for the apparent benefit
of education itself, it is important that military
commanders are aware of the serious dilemmas that
result. Their decisions should be consistent with the
need to mitigate the impact of conflict on education.
Clearly, those decisions need to be informed by an
understanding of the relevant legal rights and obligations; military action must remain within legal limits. It
is also desirable, however, to do more to protect
education than the minimum required by the law. Any
military interaction with education should be reduced
as much as possible to maximize the benefit to
education and to minimize the damage to it.

Options for changing behaviour
Changing military behaviour, especially in order to
impose additional constraints on military activity, is a
major challenge. The use of educational establishments is a sorry feature of modern warfare. What the
law demands is known and it is vitally important that
all fighting forces, both those belonging to states and
those making up armed non-state groups, are sufficiently well-disciplined and trained to comply. Even if
the law as it stands were to be fully complied with,
however, it would not result in education obtaining the
degree of protection it deserves and requires. Even
lawful behaviour by fighting forces can result in
serious damage to education. Better behaviour than
the current law demands is therefore needed.
A change in the law might be one way forward. Would
an education-specific treaty or convention be a
sensible step and could the process of achieving this
be initiated by a coalition of international organizations and NGOs rooted in civil society? There is
evidence that the contemporary normative climate is
becoming increasingly conducive to civil societyinspired changes to the law governing the conduct of
hostilities and the development of means and
methods of warfare. Both the Ottawa and Oslo
processes, on anti-personnel landmines and cluster
munitions respectively, were initiated by civil society
groups, as was the process resulting in the UN negotiations for an Arms Trade Treaty, successfully
concluded in early 2013. A convention restricting
military use of schools and universities is, therefore, a
serious option to consider.
The need to persuade states formally to engage in
negotiations and then agree to be bound by resultant
treaty provisions may, however, be a challenge too far.
Such an approach is likely to result in many powerful
or influential states either distancing themselves from
the process of negotiation or engaging with the
intention of preventing progressive rules that would
impose more constraints on military forces. Many
states would simply argue that the protection of
education is already adequately provided for in
existing treaty law. The risk is that states would not be
willing to commit in law to a more restrictive set of
rules even if they might be prepared generally to adopt

107

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

practices that would have the same result while
preserving their legal rights.
There has been evidence recently of the advantages of
taking a softer and more pragmatic approach that
might have a greater chance of succeeding than trying
to change the law. An obvious example is the
production of both the Montreux Document regulating
the activities of Private Military and Security
Companies387 and the subsequent Code of Conduct for
Private Security Service Providers.388 Another is the
establishment of Guiding Principles on Internal
Displacement.389 Such documents are not
treaties; they are not, therefore, a source of
international law and are consequently not legally
binding on states – although they do have the
potential to change or improve behaviour.390 Treaty
negotiations would be difficult to initiate; by
comparison, developing and seeking the adoption of
voluntary guidelines would be more achievable, could
change the law over time and ultimately might be
more effective.

Developing international guidelines
Following wide consultations with states representatives and other experts, GCPEA decided to develop
guidelines rather than attempt to initiate international
negotiations for a convention that would change the
applicable law. A workshop attended by a number of
experts was convened at the Geneva Academy of
International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights in
early 2012. The workshop recommended the development of a set of guidelines for protecting schools
and universities from military use during armed
conflict. The draft that eventually emerged was
shaped around several considerations, namely:
• While any guidelines should aim to effect a
change of behaviour, they should respect international law as it stands and not propose
changes to it. They should not be legally
binding in themselves or affect existing obligations under international law.
• The guidelines should reflect what is practically
achievable and acknowledge that parties to
armed conflict are invariably faced with difficult
dilemmas requiring pragmatic solutions.

108

• The guidelines should reflect good practice
already applied by some parties to armed
conflict.
• The guidelines should be produced for the use
of all parties to armed conflict, both states and
armed non-state actors.
• While the guidelines should be produced
specifically for application during armed
conflict, they should also be useful and
instructive for post-conflict and other comparable situations, including those with the
potential to turn into armed conflict.
An initial draft set of guidelines was discussed by
representatives of a number of states from regions
around the world, as well as UN organizations and
NGOs, at a workshop in Lucens, Switzerland, in late
2012. All those who attended were invited on the
understanding that their identities would not be
disclosed and their input would not be directly
attributed to the states and organizations they represented. The states included a cross-section of the
international community, ranging from NATO members
to developing states that had experienced, or were
still experiencing, armed conflicts within their
borders.

Content of the Draft Lucens Guidelines
Further drafts and discussions resulted in Draft
Guidelines published in July 2013.391 They remain in
draft form and may be amended slightly before being
finalised (at some point in 2014). There are six guidelines, as follows:
Preamble: Parties to armed conflict are urged not to
use schools and universities for any purpose in
support of the military effort. While it is acknowledged
that certain uses would not be contrary to the law of
armed conflict, all parties should endeavour to avoid
impinging on students’ safety and education, using
the following as a guide to responsible practice:
Guideline 1: Functioning schools and universities
should not be used by the fighting forces of parties to
armed conflict in any way in support of the military
effort, either for immediate tactical advantage or for
longer term purposes.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

(a)

This principle extends to schools and universities that are temporarily closed outside
normal class hours, during weekends and
holidays, and during vacation periods.

or abandoned – are ordinarily civilian objects. They
must never be destroyed as a measure intended to
deprive the opposing parties to the armed conflict of
the ability to use them in the future.

(b)

Parties to armed conflict should neither use
force nor offer incentives to education administrators to evacuate schools and universities in
order that they can be made available for use in
support of the military effort.

Guideline 4: Use of a school or university by the
fighting forces of parties to armed conflict in support
of the military effort may have the effect of turning it
into a military objective subject to attack. Parties to
armed conflict should consider all feasible alternative
measures before attacking a school or university that
has become a military objective, including warning the
enemy in advance that an attack will be forthcoming
unless it does not cease its use.

Guideline 2: Abandoned schools and universities
should not be used by the fighting forces of parties to
armed conflict for any purpose in support of the
military effort except when, and only for as long as, no
choice is possible between such use of the school or
university and another feasible method for obtaining a
similar military advantage. Appropriate alternative
premises should be presumed to be a better option,
even if they are not as convenient or as well positioned
for the desired military purpose, although all feasible
precautions should be taken to protect all civilian
objects from attack. The fighting forces of parties to
armed conflict should be mindful that they may not
have full knowledge of the potential negative consequences of their use of a school, including its effect on
a civilian population’s willingness to return to an area.
(a)

Any such use should be for the minimum time
necessary.

(b)

Abandoned schools and universities that are
used by the fighting forces of parties to armed
conflict in support of the military effort should
always remain available to allow educational
authorities to re-open them as soon as practicable, provided this would not risk endangering
the security of students and staff.

(c)

Any evidence or indication of militarization or
fortification should be completely removed
following the withdrawal of fighting forces, and
any damage caused to the infrastructure of the
institution should be promptly and fully
repaired. All munitions and unexploded
ordnance or remnants of war must be cleared
from the site.

Guideline 3: Schools and universities – be they in
session, closed for the day or for holidays, evacuated,

(a)

Prior to any attack on a school that has become
a military objective, the parties to armed
conflict should take into consideration the duty
of special care for children, and the potential
long-term negative effect on a community’s
access to education posed by the damage or
destruction of the school.

(b)

The use of a school or university by the fighting
forces of one party to a conflict in support of the
military effort should not serve as justification
for an opposing party that captures it to
continue to use it in support of the military
effort. As soon as feasible, any evidence or
indication of militarization or fortification
should be removed and the facility returned to
civilian authorities for the purpose of its educational function.

Guideline 5: The fighting forces of parties to armed
conflict should generally not be employed on security
tasks related to schools and universities except when
the risk to those institutions is assessed as high; if
alternative means of reducing the likelihood of attack
are not feasible; if evacuation from the high risk area is
not feasible; and if there are no alternative appropriately trained civilian personnel available to provide
security.
(a)

If such fighting forces are engaged in security
tasks related to schools and universities, their
presence within the grounds or buildings of the
school should be avoided if at all possible, to
avoid compromising its civilian status and
disrupting the learning environment.

PART II — THeMATIC eSSAYS

Guideline 6: All parties to armed conflict should, as far
as possible and as appropriate, incorporate these
Guidelines into their doctrine, military manuals, rules
of engagement, operational orders and other means
of dissemination, to encourage appropriate practice
throughout the chain of command.

Raising awareness of the Lucens
Guidelines
Securing implementation of the Guidelines requires a
powerful campaign to raise awareness. This needs to
reach out to both states and armed non-state actors.
Increased awareness of the practice and consequences of the military use of schools and universities
is vital — to prompt recognition of the need for
guidance and to increase the political will to secure
buy-in from government decision-makers and key
stakeholders from the wider domains of both
government and civil society.
How will the Guidelines be dealt with by military forces
and by relevant government departments in states?
Different states will approach the process of implementation, promulgation and achievement of an
appropriate degree of compliance in different ways.
There will be no hard and fast or universally acceptable
means of achieving these things. Civil society organizations will be key partners in this endeavour,
alongside those states willing to champion both the
reasoning behind the Guidelines and their content.
Supportive states will be important but so too will
armed non-state actors who will be made aware of the
benefits of compliance through support from NGOs.

Implementing the Lucens Guidelines
Each state will have its own ways of applying the
Guidelines. This is the case even for NATO members.
While NATO is the most sophisticated multinational
military organization in the world, with military
doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedures promulgated in Allied Publications, individual member states
retain publications for exclusively national use. Each
will decide how best to ensure compliance and,
although there will be similarities, one cannot assume
that all will do this in the same way. Some may choose

110

to incorporate the Guidelines into doctrine, some to
include them in relevant manuals (including those
dealing with the law of armed conflict) and some
might favour reflecting them in command and control
arrangements (such as rules of engagement).
Doctrine is essentially ‘that which is taught’. It is a
guide for military commanders about ways of
achieving tactical and operational success. It establishes ways of thinking about operations and also acts
as a way of promulgating procedures necessary to
make a military force work as a coherent whole. It is
important at all levels, from military-strategic to
tactical, but for the Guidelines the tactical level will be
especially significant. Since doctrine provides the
framework and content of tactical training, it would be
a good way of ensuring compliance with the
Guidelines.
Another way to promulgate Guidelines would be in
legal manuals. The Guidelines are not law, however;
indeed, they are an attempt to provide more
protection for education than the law currently
demands. For this reason, some states may include
them in legal manuals; others may not. Importantly,
many states do not have legal manuals of their own.392
The more sophisticated military powers do, but most
states do not and often rely on commercially
published versions – including versions produced by
the more established military powers,393 such as the
United Kingdom and German armed forces, for
example, which reflect the views of those governments.394 It would be useful if states with their own
legal manuals could be persuaded to adopt the
Guidelines and reflect them in their manuals, but it
may take some time – the UK’s manual was first
published in 2004 and is only now undergoing its first
review.
A further suggestion is to reflect them in rules of
engagement (ROE). There is value in this approach
because ROE are a command and control mechanism
giving precise instructions to those operating at the
tactical level about what they can and cannot do. For
example, if a state had adopted the Guidelines and, in
so doing, had agreed not to use school buildings for
military purpose except in extreme circumstances,
high-level commanders could use ROE to either

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

restrict a tactical commander’s choices or allow him to
use a school exceptionally if the situation demanded it.
Another issue to consider is enforcement. No international agreement is automatically enforceable, even
if it is agreed in a treaty. The Guidelines will not be
binding internationally – but this does not mean they
cannot be legally binding domestically. Breaches of
the Guidelines would be unlawful if they contravene
orders issued through the military chain of command.
Non-compliance would then represent an offence
under the military justice arrangements in the states
that adopt them.

and capable of implementation through a range of
mechanisms that are already employed to achieve
compliance with the law.
Once the final version of the Lucens Guidelines has
been produced, they will require endorsement or
adoption, implementation and some measure of
compliance and enforcement. As GCPEA and other
bodies take the Guidelines forward, additional
thought needs to be devoted to how the least capable
states and armed non-state actors might be advised to
proceed and what mechanisms they will need to put in
place to ensure compliance.

Armed non-state groups are most unlikely to use the
range of publications and command and control
mechanisms common within the armed forces of
states. Such groups often emerge or coalesce during
crises within states and their command arrangements
will often be informal. Although some groups exist for
extended periods, many are short-lived coalitions of
disparate elements. The most effective and organized
will have a command and control process of some
sort, however. The Guidelines will require implementation through that. A number of organizations work
with armed non-state groups to promote their
compliance with international law; these organizations could be encouraged to include the Guidelines in
this work.

Conclusions
It is evident that a great deal needs to be done to
protect education – students, teachers, academics,
administrators and the schools, universities and other
establishments in which education is delivered – from
the effects of armed conflict. This is particularly the
case when it comes to military use of schools and
universities. The Draft Lucens Guidelines are
consistent with the law but are intended to lead to
behaviour on the ground that should provide a greater
degree of protection than even the law demands. The
Guidelines have been produced through a process
that has involved substantial input from the military
and defence and foreign ministries of a range of interested states. The process has also taken into account
the special demands of the armed non-state actor
community. The Guidelines are pragmatic, realistic

AFGHANISTAN
The UN reported more than 1,000 attacks on education
in 2009-2012, including schools being set on fire,
suicide bombings and remotely detonated bombs,
killings of staff, threats to staff and abductions.
Given the challenges in collecting and verifying
reports in Afghanistan, the true number may well be
significantly higher.

Context
During 2009-2012, armed opposition groups,
including the Taliban, continued to fight to regain
control of the country, which they lost in 2001 to USbacked forces.
NATO assumed responsibility for security in
Afghanistan from the US-led coalition in 2006.
Following military setbacks, in March 2009, US
President Barack Obama announced a new policy of
increasing US forces there in the short term, taking
the total number of foreign troops to 130,000, while
agreeing to hand control of security to Afghan forces
by December 2014.
By the end of 2012, the Taliban had a strong influence
over areas of the south and east but also maintained
pockets of control and the ability to carry out attacks
in every region of the country. In 2011, the Afghan
government and its international partners began
efforts to hold peace negotiations with the Taliban
but there was little concrete progress by mid-2013.395
In addition to the Taliban, numerous other armed
anti-government groups were active, some affiliated
with the Taliban and some pursuing separate
agendas. The situation was further complicated by
the unpredictable activities of village militias
(arbakai) – some allied with or supported by the
government of Afghan President Karzai and some
operating independently – and the Afghan Local
Police, a village-level defence force established by
the Afghan government at the urging of the US to
defend communities from attack.396
The Taliban and other groups have for many years
attacked schools, teachers and students.397 Along
with other forms of insecurity, this violence has
impeded access to education and in some areas

actually rolled back progress made after schools
reopened in 2002. In 2009, for example, more than 70
per cent of schools in Helmand province and more
than 80 per cent in Zabul province were closed.398 In
May 2012, the Ministry of Education reported that
more than 590 schools were closed in areas at risk,
mostly in Helmand, Zabul and Kandahar provinces.399
As of 2011,400 gross primary enrolment401 was 97 per
cent, gross secondary enrolment was 52 per cent and
gross tertiary enrolment was 4 per cent.402 Net attendance was only 66 per cent for boys and 40 per cent for
girls at primary school level, and 18 per cent for boys
and 6 per cent for girls at secondary level (20072011).403

Attacks on schools
Types of attacks on schools included the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), landmines and suicide
bombs in or around school buildings, rocket attacks,
grenades thrown into school playgrounds or facilities,
the burning down of buildings, looting and forced
closure of schools.404
The UN reported 613 school-related attacks in JanuaryNovember 2009, compared with 348 in the whole of
2008, with attacks on schools increasing in areas
around Kabul and in the east, including in the
provinces of Wardak, Logar, Khost, Laghman, Kunar
and Nangarhar.405 For instance, unknown armed men
used dynamite to blast a high school in Nadir Shahkot
district of Khost province in May 2009, destroying 18
classrooms.406 However, the number of incidents
dropped to 197 in 2010. There were spikes in the
number of attacks in September 2010, at the time of
the parliamentary elections, just as there were during
the 2009 presidential elections, when schools were
used as polling stations.407 But the number fell to 167
in 2012. (There were at least 133 attacks on schools or
school-related victims in 2011, but the UN report did
not clarify how many other of the 185 incidents of
attacks on schools and hospitals were attacks on
schools.) 408
Anti-government groups were responsible for the ‘vast
majority’ of attacks in 2012, the UN Mission in
Afghanistan, UNAMA, verified.409 However, these
groups operated both covertly and publicly,

116

sometimes claiming responsibility for attacks and
sometimes denying activities attributed to them by
others, making the overall conflict – and efforts to
determine the source of attacks – complex. The UN
Mission also verified four attacks by armed groups
that were not anti-government in 2012 and at least
nine by Afghan Local Police,410 as well as one incident
in which American forces ‘bombarded’ a school in
Nangarhar province, injuring 12 children and a school
employee and damaging the school building.411 The
UN Secretary-General’s Report on Children and Armed
Conflict said that among documented – as opposed to
verified412 – incidents, attacks by anti-government
elements outnumbered those by pro-government
forces by two to one and approximately one in four
attacks were by unidentified perpetrators.413 An earlier
study reported that criminal gangs have also
threatened or attacked schools in Afghanistan.414
Motives for attacks by armed non-state groups
included opposition to the perceived ‘western’ or ‘unIslamic’ curriculum, external affiliations of the school
or the perceived role of Western forces in rebuilding
some schools, the education of girls generally, or any
operation of the central government.415 Other attacks
were motivated by the wider political objectives of the
insurgency in particular areas or the use of schools by
opposing forces (see the Military use of schools
section of this profile).416
In 2012, the Taliban made public statements saying it
did not oppose education but only curricula that tried
to supplant Islamic and national values with western
culture. It also denied responsibility for attacks on
schools. Nevertheless, the UN reported that attacks
and threats of attack continued in areas controlled by
anti-government groups, including the Taliban.417 In
some places, the Taliban allowed schools to reopen,
sometimes due to public opposition to their
continuing closure. In these areas, there is evidence
that Taliban officials sought to control the curriculum
and the appointment of teachers, and place additional
restrictions on girls.418 They also appointed
‘controllers’ or shadow directors who distributed
Taliban directives on schools and pressed local
officials to change the curriculum in line with Taliban
thinking. In some cases, they checked if teachers and
students were turning up to school. 419

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
In addition to schools being damaged, destroyed or
shut down, students, teachers and other education
personnel were killed, injured, abducted and driven
away from their schools. School students, teachers
and other education personnel were killed or injured
by the use of IEDs and suicide bombing attacks.420
Grenades were lobbed into schoolyards.421 Bombs
were hidden in pushcarts and rickshaws, or carried on
motorbikes.422 For instance, on 20 October 2010, at
least eight children were killed when a powerful
roadside bomb blasted a school bus carrying girls in
the Khash Rod district of Nimrod province.423 On 3 July
2011, a suspected militant on a motorbike threw a
grenade at the main gate of a school in Faryab
province, wounding 17 children, two critically.424 On 3
May 2012, three students and two teachers were
injured when an attacker threw a grenade into the
playground of Mir Ghulam Mohmmad Ghubar High
School in Kabul.425
According to UN figures, at least 24 teachers and other
education personnel and 23 students were killed and
342 students and 41 teachers and education
personnel were injured in attacks on education in
2009.426 In 2010, at least 21 students, teachers or
education officials were killed.427 In 2011, 25
education staff members were killed and seven
abducted; in one incident, six teachers were killed and
one abducted, allegedly by anti-government
elements.428 UNAMA recorded six instances of
targeted killings of teachers, school guards and
department of education officials by anti-government
elements during the first six months of 2012 — an
increase compared with the first six months of 2011.429
Separately reported, one of the most serious incidents
in 2012 involved an ambush in May of a convoy of
education officials travelling to visit schools in Paktika
province. According to the police and a provincial
government spokesperson, the convoy was hit by a
remotely detonated roadside bomb and then came
under gunfire. Five officials were killed and three
others wounded.430
Threats to girl students and their teachers
Attackers frequently targeted girls’ education. ‘Night

letters’ – threatening letters placed at night outside
schools, en route to the school or outside teachers’
homes – were distributed in the southern, southeastern, central and northern regions, warning entire
communities not to send their daughters to school
and calling on teachers and government employees to
close schools, especially girls’ schools. Some letters
warned that failure to comply with the demand would
lead to retribution, such as acid or gas attacks.431 In
another example, in 2009, a teacher at a girls’ school
received a letter with Taliban insignia that forced her to
quit her post: ‘We warn you to leave your job as a
teacher as soon as possible otherwise we will cut the
heads off your children and we shall set fire to your
daughter…This is your first and last warning.’432 In
some cases, the threats were carried out. In May 2011,
for instance, the head teacher of Porak girls’ school,
Logar province, was shot and killed near his home
after receiving repeated death threats telling him not
to teach girls.433
Alleged poison attacks
There were numerous allegations of mass school
poisonings, either through intentional contamination
of drinking water or by the release of gas into the air,
including 17 such alleged incidents in the first half of
2012.434 Although no scientific evidence has been
found to support these attacks, they have escalated
fear and disrupted children’s access to education. For
example, on 12 May 2009, at Qazaaq school, north of
Kabul, five girls reportedly went into comas and
almost 100 others were hospitalised, allegedly due to
the release of toxic gas.435 Similar attacks were
reported at other girls’ schools.436 An alleged poison
attack in Kunduz city in 2010 caused 1,500 girls to
miss classes at Khadeja-tul Kubra high school.437 By
mid-2012, hundreds of students and education staff
affected by such incidents had been treated by
medical officials for symptoms such as nausea and
unconsciousness.
In June 2012, Afghanistan’s National Directorate of
Security announced that it had arrested 15 people,
including two schoolgirls, who confessed to
involvement in poison attacks in Takhar province.438
However, UNAMA expressed concern that the people

117

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

arrested had been tortured and that the publicizing of
the confessions compromised the right to a fair trial.439
In July 2012, UNAMA reported 17 alleged poisonings,
particularly targeting girls’ schools. In all cases it
reviewed, however, it found no evidence of ‘deliberate
acts to harm’. Testing of contaminated water by the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the
World Health Organization (WHO) and government
departments found no evidence of toxic substances,
and forensic testing of other potential sources of
poison proved inconclusive.440 Preliminary WHO
investigations of some cases pointed to mass hysteria
as the likely cause.441

Military use of schools
Schools were also used for military purposes. The UN
Secretary-General reported that international military
forces used schools on five occasions in 2010,442 and
that in 2011 schools were taken over 20 times by
armed groups and 11 times by pro-government forces,
totalling 31 incidents of military use of schools.443 In
2012, 10 schools were used for military purposes,
three of them by anti-government elements and seven
by pro-government forces.444
Although most occupations were temporary, local
elders in Kapisa province told UNAMA in 2012 that the
Afghan National Army (ANA) had used a school
building for the previous four years, forcing staff to
teach pupils outside.
There was also evidence that occupation of schools by
security forces made the buildings a target for attack.
For instance, in May 2012, after police occupied two
schools in Badakhshan province, displacing the
students and teachers, anti-government elements
fired a rocket-propelled grenade into the school
compound, damaging the building, and warned local
officials that they would continue to target schools
used for military purposes. In June, the forces vacated
both schools.445

Attacks on higher education
Several universities were also targeted. For example, a
new Islamic university, Jamiyat’al-Uloom’al-Islamiya,
in Jalalabad, was badly damaged in a bomb attack on
8 February 2011, following threatening letters
accusing the university and three local seminaries of

118

‘spreading western propaganda and poisoning the
minds of the young generation in Afghanistan’.446
According to news reports, the threats and bombing
caused 120 students to drop out.447
The use of suicide bombers extended to at least one
university as well as to schools. On 7 February 2012,
government officials reported that a blast from a
suicide bomb car attack close to the entrance to
Kandahar University killed at least seven people and
also wounded 23.448
In another case, Sunni students attacked Shiite
students at Kabul University in late November 2012 to
prevent them from observing Ashura – the festival of
the martyrdom of Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet
Muhammad – inside a dormitory mosque. Around 100
students were involved in the fighting, university
buildings were damaged, one student was killed after
being thrown out of a window and up to 30 were
wounded.449

Attacks on education in 2013
According to the Ministry of Education, approximately
100 teachers and education officials were killed
between January and August, some of them by assassination, others in roadside bombings and
crossfire.450 In June, in one incident with heavy
casualties, a suicide bomber on a motorcycle
detonated his explosives close to a boys’ high school
in Chamkani district, at going home time when ISAF
and Afghan Local Police forces were passing, killing 10
students and injuring 15 others.451 The UN said tactics
such as suicide bombings close to schools could be
war crimes.452 In other incidents, UNAMA reported that
a student was abducted and killed in May in Bak
district, Khost province, after chanting an anti-Taliban
song, and an education officer was shot and injured
while visiting schools to monitor them in Kunar
province in June;453 and in August, a teacher’s home in
the Sangin district of Helmand province was targeted –
an explosive device was set off outside the house of a
teacher who had previously received threats to leave
his job, killing two children.454 Three education administrators were also shot dead in Parwan, Uruzgan and
Herat provinces by unknown gunmen in August.455
Schools and universities were threatened,456 set on
fire457 or used as bases for combat,458 and there were

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

continuing reports of alleged mass poisonings of
schoolgirls,459 although there was no verification of
whether poisoning took place.
In May, the Taliban forced schools in Zabul province to
close after the local government banned motorcycles
as a security measure because they were being used
in assassinations.460

BAHRAIN
Following the outbreak of anti-government protests in
2011, students, teachers and academics were arrested
from schools and universities and teacher association
leaders were imprisoned. There were many incidents of
sectarian threats and intimidation in schools and
universities that year.461

Context
The majority of attacks on education in Bahrain
occurred amid the unrest that erupted in February and
March 2011 during a wave of protests inspired by the
uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But repercussions
continued into 2012.
In February 2011, authorities forcibly suppressed
peaceful anti-government and pro-democracy
protests. Seven people were killed and many more
were wounded.462 Members of both the majority Shia
community, which has called for a greater voice in the
government, and the Sunni community joined the
demonstrations for political reforms.463 After weeks of
protests, the government declared a three-month
state of emergency and called in Saudi military forces
to help keep order.464 Sporadic protests against the
government continued into 2013, and the country’s
human rights situation reportedly deteriorated.465
Political tensions were reflected in schools and universities. In early 2011, thousands of teachers went on
strike, first demanding respect for human rights and
later calling for better security;466 thousands of
students participated in protests, including in and
around their schools; police entered school facilities
to arrest students; and political and sectarian clashes
involving students and parents occurred on school
grounds.467

Political activities were prohibited at universities and
schools, as well as at other government buildings and
public institutions.468 Teacher trade unions, along with
other government sector trade unions, were banned in
2003 by the Civil Service Bureau Act 1.469 The Ministry
of Social Development dissolved the Bahrain Teachers
Association, formed as a response to the ban on
unions, in April 2011, alleging that it had incited
teachers and students to strike.470
Net primary enrolment was 98 per cent (2006),471 net
secondary enrolment was 93 per cent (2011) and gross
tertiary enrolment was 37 per cent (2011).472 The adult
literacy rate was 92 per cent (2010).473

Attacks on schools
The Ministry of Education reported a pattern of attacks
on government schools, typically involving damage to
facilities by setting them on fire or throwing Molotov
cocktails. Approximately 200 schools were reportedly
attacked between September 2011 and October
2013.474 However, it was not clear whether these were
acts of political protest or, rather, vandalism.

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
During 2011, police arrested students and teachers for
their political activities from school facilities,
including from at least 15 girls’ schools, according to
the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR).475 In July
2011, BCHR said it had received reports of arrests of 66
teachers, predominantly women, although it said the
actual number may have been higher.476 In December
2012, BCHR reported that police stopped a school bus
carrying boys from an elementary and an intermediate
school and held them at a police station until their
parents came to sign a pledge.477 According to BCHR,
some students and teachers arrested from schools
reported that police interrogated and beat them, and
threatened them with sexual assault.478
There were also reports of numerous suspensions and
sackings, as well as salary deductions, of teachers
and Bahrain Teacher Association members who were
accused of having taken part in the February 2011 antigovernment protests. On 15 June 2011, for example,
the independent newspaper Al-Wasat reported that
the Al-Ahd Al-Zaher School had sacked eight teachers

119

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

and, on 27 June, the Unions Federation in Bahrain
reported that the Ministry of Education had sacked 60
employees, mostly teachers.479
On 25 September 2011, a military court sentenced the
president of the Bahrain Teachers Association, Mahdi
Abu Deeb, to 10 years in prison on charges of using his
position within the BTA to call for a strike by teachers,
halting the educational process, inciting hatred of the
regime and attempting to overthrow the ruling system
by force, possessing pamphlets and disseminating
fabricated stories and information. Abu Deeb alleged
that he endured torture in pre-trial detention.480 His
deputy, Jailila al-Salmaan, received a three-year
sentence. In October 2012, a court of appeal reduced
their sentences to five years and six months respectively.481
Clashes between rival groups of students and their
parents led to violence on school grounds. For
example, according to the Bahrain Independent
Commission of Inquiry (BICI), on 10 March 2011, at the
Saar High School for Girls, an argument between antigovernment and pro-government pupils led to parents
converging on the school. Some students and parents
threatened the headmistress and staff and threw
rocks at a school building in which they had taken
refuge. Riot control forces were sent to disperse the
crowds. Eight students were injured and received
medical care. Other schools reported similar incidents
on a much smaller scale.482
The BICI report also documented complaints of abuse
against members of the Sunni community at schools
because of their religious affiliation or refusal to join
protests.483 In total, the BICI report identified ‘approximately 83’ incidents of sectarian threats in
universities and schools, including verbal abuse and
harassment of students as well as physical assaults.484

Attacks on higher education
Most incidents affecting higher education occurred
during, or as a result of, the protests of February and
March 2011 in which university students and
professors participated. According to the president of
the University of Bahrain, on 13 March 2011, 55
individuals were treated in intensive care after clashes
at the campus between government supporters and

120

5,000 anti-government protesters.485 The University of
Bahrain and Bahrain Polytechnic subsequently
suspended classes until mid-May and late April
respectively.486
According to the BICI report, 73 students were arrested
or detained after February 2011 and some were
imprisoned for more than three months.487 Security
forces also questioned at least 15 professors from
three universities for several hours before releasing
them without charge, and detained one for over four
months, Human Rights Watch reported.488 One
professor said he was detained with 10 other
colleagues on suspicion of having participated in
protests – and that Interior Ministry officials went to
the university and ordered them to report to a police
station, where they were blindfolded, interrogated
and beaten before being released.489
During 2011, the government also dismissed
professors and suspended or expelled hundreds of
university students for participation in demonstrations and political activities. At the University of
Bahrain, students not charged with violent crimes
were reinstated but were required to sign loyalty
pledges and received warnings not to engage in
political activity on campus.490 Of those charged with
crimes, at least six were sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.491 The University of Bahrain also dismissed 19
academics on charges that included participation in
protests;492 by the end of 2012, they had all been
reinstated.493
Prior to the 2011 events, there was one reported
incident concerning an academic. Dr Abduljalil alSingace, a professor of engineering at the University of
Bahrain, was detained in 2010 after speaking about
the country’s human rights practices during a seminar
at the UK House of Lords.494 His lawyer reported that
during detention, al-Singace was deprived of sleep
and the crutches and wheelchair he relied upon,
subjected to physical violence that resulted in a partial
loss of hearing and denied medical treatment.495 In
June 2011, a military court sentenced him to life in
prison, a decision the Supreme Court upheld in
January 2013.496

On 16 April, police raided the Jabreya Secondary
School for Boys in Manama, firing tear gas and
clashing with students who were peacefully
demanding the release of one of their classmates,
arrested from the school the previous day.497 Injuries
among students were reported and one was allegedly
arrested at the scene.498

CeNTRAL AFRICAN RePUBLIC
Most attacks took place after the Séléka rebellion in
late 2012 and during 2013. More than 100 schools were
damaged, destroyed or looted, two dozen were used for
military purposes and there were reports of students
and teachers being killed. By early 2013, one in two
schools had closed.

Context
The Central African Republic (CAR) has experienced
decades of political unrest, including two conflicts in
the past ten years and ongoing violence, particularly in
the north.499 Various armed rebel groups, including the
Popular Army for the Restoration of the Republic and of
Democracy (APRD), the Union of Democratic Forces for
Unity (UFDR), and the Convention of Patriots for Justice
and Peace (CPJP), fought government forces between
2004 and 2011.500 The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a
rebel group originally from Uganda, spread its operations into south-east CAR after 2008.501
In late 2012, renewed conflict broke out when a group
of rebel forces known as Séléka (meaning ‘coalition’ in
Sango), comprised primarily of UFDR and CPJP dissidents and members of the Patriotic Convention for the
Salvation of Kodro (CPSK), accused President François
Bozizé’s government of failing to abide by previous
peace agreements.502 Séléka’s military campaign from
the north to the capital Bangui in the south-west
culminated in a coup d’état on 24 March 2013 and the
formation of a new transitional government.503
However, for months after the coup, law and order
broke down and Séléka forces committed serious
human rights abuses against civilians.504 In October
2013, a UN Security Council Resolution was unanimously approved to deploy an African Union (AU)
peacekeeping force and to support a possible UN

peacekeeping mission.505 By early December 2013,
amid escalating violence, French troops were
additionally deployed to CAR after the Security Council
authorized their temporary intervention and the use of
‘all necessary measures’ to support the AU-led peacekeeping force in protecting civilians and restoring
order.506
The education system suffered as teachers and
students were displaced and schools were shut,
damaged or destroyed.507 By April 2013, nearly half of
CAR’s schools had closed508 and more than 650,000
children were out of school.509
Net enrolment at primary level was estimated at 69 per
cent in 2011, and 14 per cent at secondary level, while
gross tertiary enrolment was only 3 per cent. The
estimated adult literacy rate was 57 per cent.510 In the
northern conflict-affected regions, net primary
enrolment was only 48 per cent in 2012.511

Attacks on schools
No attacks on or looting of infrastructure were
reported in 2009 or 2010 but due to fear of fighting in
the eastern part of the country, including LRA raids,
parents kept many students out of school.512 In 2011,
according to the UN, 12 schools were used, attacked or
destroyed in fighting between CPJP, UFDR and FPR.513 In
2012, fewer attacks were reported on schools and
hospitals than in 2011.514

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Teachers were abducted and killed in 2010, but it was
not clear whether this was related to their work.515
In 2011, the UN reported teachers in Bria, the capital of
Haute-Kotto prefecture, being assaulted by armed
groups because their schools were in areas under the
control of rival groups.516

Military use of schools
CPJP elements used schools in villages in Haute-Kotto
between May and July 2010,517 while in 2011, more
were used during confrontations between CPJP and
UFDR, as well as during attacks by the Chadian rebel
group the Popular Front for Recovery (FPR).518 In
January 2012, a Chadian army helicopter landed on a
school in Ouadango (Nana Grébizi prefecture),

121

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

destroying the building; also, two schools were used
as outposts by CPJP in Yangoudrounja (Haute-Kotto
prefecture) and Miamani (Bamingui-Bangoran
prefecture).519

Attacks on education in 2013
Attacks spiked at the time of the Séléka rebellion in
late 2012 and heightened insecurity in 2013. An
assessment conducted by the Education Cluster in
CAR, which surveyed some 176 schools in conflictaffected areas, reported that at least 108 of the
schools had been looted or vandalized by rebels,
soldiers and local populations; 14 were hit by bullets
(in four cases intentionally, two of which occurred
while school was in session) and two were specifically
targeted by shells; and three were intentionally set on
fire.520
There were numerous alleged attacks on students and
teachers during the fighting in late 2012 and in 2013
that occurred at or near schools.521 According to the
Education Cluster, at least two teachers were
reportedly killed intentionally; the wife of a school
director was killed at school; and a school student was
shot dead. It also reported allegations of ‘many atrocities’ committed at schools in Haute-Kotto, including
the rape of girls and the killing of one teacher.522
Séléka members reportedly robbed or assaulted two
teachers, and entered at least one school and told
students if they returned to class they would be taken
hostage.523 In another case, a child soldier entered his
former school and threatened to detonate a grenade if
schooling continued.524
Between December 2012 and August 2013, at least 24
schools were occupied or used by combatants in
Bamingui-Bangoran, Kémo, Ombella-M’Poko, Bangui,
Haute-Kotto, Nana-Grébizi and Ouaka prefectures,
four of which by the military.525 Many of these schools
reported looting and damage. 526

COLOMBIA
Some 140 school teachers were murdered and more
than 1,000 school teachers received death threats in
2009-2012, with threats increasing in 2013. Children
were recruited from school by armed groups and there
continued to be reports of public security forces using
schools for military purposes, despite legal curbs.

Context
Violence and abuses associated with Colombia’s
internal armed conflict, which has continued for nearly
half a century, have displaced more than 5 million
people.527 Approximately 220,000 people have died,
according to the government-created National Center
for Historical Memory.528
The main actors involved in the fighting have included
government armed forces and the police; left-wing
armed groups, notably the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation
Army (ELN); and right-wing paramilitaries, especially
the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC),
which underwent a deeply flawed official demobilization process during the administration of President
Álvaro Uribe (2002-2010). New paramilitary successor
groups, led largely by former paramilitaries, emerged
after the demobilization process.529
Juan Manuel Santos replaced Álvaro Uribe as
president in 2010 and initiated peace talks with the
FARC in November 2012.530
Human rights defenders, community leaders, trade
unionists, journalists, indigenous and Afro-Colombian
leaders, and displaced persons’ leaders have all faced
death threats and other abuses during the conflict.
According to the teachers’ trade union the Colombian
Federation of Educators (FECODE), 360 teachers were
murdered and 342 threatened in the decade up to
2009.531 The president of the National University of
Colombia is reported to have stated that the university
registered 312 reports of threats in 2007 and 2008.532
At least twelve Colombian university students were
killed between 2006 and 2008, most of whom were
well-known student leaders, according to a report by
the UK’s National Union of Students, University and
College Union and UK-based NGO Justice for
Colombia.533

In 2011, net enrolment in primary school was 87 per
cent, net secondary enrolment 76 per cent and gross
tertiary enrolment 43 per cent.534 Adult literacy was 93
per cent (2009).535

Attacks on schools
At least two schools were directly targeted. In one
case, a school was attacked both by armed groups and
armed forces. In February 2010, for instance, FARC
combatants forced their way into a rural school in
Nariño department during a meeting of the indigenous
community, according to the UN. The Colombian
armed forces attacked the FARC members inside the
school. Suspected of collusion with the enemy by both
sides, 300 members of the indigenous community
reportedly fled.536 In the other case, in June 2010, a
bomb blew up in a school in rural Cauca, allegedly
targeting Colombian military forces while they were
inside it.537
The International Committee of the Red Cross registered five incidents of education facilities destroyed in
hostilities and 10 more affected by nearby explosives
and ordnance from 2009 to 2012.538
The UN reported three incidents of mines left near
schools during the reporting period. For example, in
Valle del Cauca, the FARC left behind mines after using
a school as a shield, causing lessons to be suspended
for six months.539 A 2012 Watchlist on Children and
Armed Conflict report also warned that guerrillas were
increasingly planting landmines without a record of
their location, preventing children from walking to
school.540

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Figures for the number of teachers murdered vary.
According to teachers’ union FECODE, the number of
its members killed remained steady for the first three
years of the reporting period (27 in 2009, 27 in 2010,
21 in 2011), then dropped to 13 in 2012.541 The Escuela
Nacional Sindical (ENS), a prominent Colombian NGO
monitoring labour rights, reported 21 murders of
unionized teachers in 2009, 28 in 2010, 16 in 2011 and
just four in 2012.542 The Ministry of Education’s
numbers, which include both unionized and nonunionized teachers, were higher overall but with lower

126

totals for unionized teachers: 34 (of whom 15 were
unionized) were killed in 2009, 40 (21) in 2010, 36 (17)
in 2011, and 30 (9) in 2012.543
Compared with the number of teachers killed, five to
10 times as many death threats were reported.
Ministry of Education figures (for all teachers) and ENS
figures (for unionized teachers only) differ, but both
exceed 1,000 death threats in 2009-2012. The
breakdown by year is set out below:

By comparison, FECODE’s figures were much higher:
more than 3,000 teachers reported threats against
them in 2011 and 2,000 reported threats between
January and September 2012.545
Teachers may be targeted for a number of reasons.
Some teachers in remote areas, where armed nonstate groups are strong and schools are the only
visible presence of the state, are accused by illegal
armed groups of collaborating with the enemy.
Teachers have also been targeted for playing an
important social and leadership role in the
community. Armed groups have threatened teachers
for trying to lead community efforts to protect children
from sexual violence and child recruitment and other
efforts that challenge the groups’ activities.546
Teacher murders can prompt wider community instability. According to the UN, in June 2009, an entire
indigenous community was forced to flee their homes
in Arauca province after suspected members of the
FARC shot a teacher from their village in front of his
pupils. In Cauca in 2010, the FARC allegedly killed two
teachers and then threatened all the teachers in one
rural area of that department, forcing all teachers to

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

flee the area and leaving 320 children without
schooling.547

threatened or because one of their classmates was
killed, according to the Ombudsman.555

According to ENS, 305 unionized teachers suffered
forced displacement in 2009-2012.548

Military use of schools

In 2010, the government strengthened protections for
teachers at risk of violence by a decree offering such
teachers ‘provisional status’ so that they could
relocate rapidly while they waited for police to carry
out a risk assessment. A year later, another decree
added another teacher trade union representative to
the ‘Threatened Teachers’ Committee’ in territories
that had more than 5,000 teachers, and the period of
provisional status was increased from three to six
months in cases where the police could not complete
their investigation in time.549
According to a report by the National Ministry of
Education, of the 600 teaching staff who reported
receiving death threats in 2011, 38 left the country,
282 were given temporary transfers and 38 were transferred permanently.550
The International Trade Union Confederation reported
that on 9 September 2010, Segundo Salvador Forero, a
member of the teachers’ trade union EDUCAL, was
killed in Anserma, Caldas, after the local education
ministry rejected a request made to them by his union
to grant him ‘threatened person’ status, which would
have given him the right to transfer to a safe
location.551
Paramilitary successor groups and affiliated criminal
gangs also attacked students on their way to and from
school. In Medellín, the Ombudsman registered the
murder of 11 students while they were going to or
returning from school in 2009 and four more in
2010.552 These killings occurred almost exclusively in
the violence-wracked poor neighbourhoods known as
‘comunas’553 where criminal gangs, which often acted
as local franchises of paramilitary successor groups,
fought for territorial control.554 In 2011, the
Ombudsman’s Office declared that 23 schools in
Medellín were at risk from armed groups because they
were situated on the invisible boundaries between
gang territories, according to UNHCR. That same year
in Medellín, 965 students transferred from, or simply
dropped out of, six education institutions after being

Colombia is one of the few nations that explicitly limits
or prohibits the use of schools and other education
facilities by their armed forces.556 Nonetheless, there
continued to be reports of security forces using
schools during the reporting period. The UN reported
serious concerns over the occupation of schools by
national security forces in the departments of
Antioquia, Arauca, Cauca, Córdoba and Norte de
Santander in 2010,557 and by the Colombian National
Army in those same departments plus Huila, Nariño
and Valle de Cauca in 2011.558
The ICRC recorded 75 cases of occupation of school
facilities by all armed actors from 2009 to 2012.559
On 2 June 2012, the FARC attacked a police outpost
located on the grounds of the Chilví Education
Institution, Nariño department, according to CINEP, a
Colombian human rights organization.560 The police
reportedly left their outpost, which was constructed
out of wood, and fled to the neighbouring school,
which was made of brick. In the firefight, about 70 per
cent of the school was damaged, according to CINEP.
Public concerns had previously been raised about the
risks involved in locating a police station close to the
civilian population. CINEP reported that the police had
stayed years longer than the originally agreed three
months and the Tumaco Secretary of Education had
specifically asked for the station to be relocated. After
the attack, students had to be moved to schools in
neighbouring areas and teachers did not want to teach
in Chilví due to the lack of security. A day after the
school rector asked the police to relocate during a
public meeting, he received death threats and was
forced to flee, according to CINEP.561
The 2012 Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict
report described police in Putumayo using schools as
a base for operations against guerrillas or failing to
comply with a requirement to stay at least 200 metres
away from schools. Police presence led to schools
being attacked by guerrillas; and police reportedly
sexually harassed female pupils and stole school food

supplies, according to Watchlist on Children and
Armed Conflict.562

Child recruitment from schools
The Early Warning System of the Ombudsman’s Office
identified the FARC, ELN, El Ejército Popular
Revolucionario Antiterrorista de Colombia (ERPAC),563
Los Paisas, Los Urabeños, Águilas Negras and Los
Rastrojos as groups recruiting children during the
reporting period.564 According to the UN, some of this
recruitment took place in schools.565 The 2012
Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict report
confirmed guerrilla and paramilitary successor groups
used schools for recruitment.566
According to the UN, a teacher in Chocó intervened in
the attempted recruitment of two teenage boys on
school grounds by the ELN guerrilla group in April
2010. Both the teacher and the students then fled,
fearing retaliation.567 In 2012, the Ombudsman
reported that in Vichada Department FARC members
approached two students of the Escuela Santa
Teresita del Tuparro on their way to school to obtain
information about the school for recruiting
purposes.568
The national Ombudsman reported that both the FARC
and paramilitary successor groups were using schools
to indoctrinate students as a first step towards
recruitment.569 Rural boarding schools were particularly targeted for recruitment purposes by armed
groups because of their isolation. For instance,
recruitment was carried out by suspected guerrillas in
education centres and boarding schools in rural Vista
Hermosa and Puerto Rico municipalities. Other
boarding schools were targeted by paramilitary
successor groups.570 In 2012, a teacher in Putumayo
was arrested for teaching FARC ideology to children at
school, including making them sing the FARC
anthem.571 In Vista Hermosa, Meta, during the week of
12-18 March 2012, guerrillas believed to be part of
FARC’s 27th Front called meetings with students at
several rural schools in the area, offering them snacks
for their attendance, and appeared to attempt to
indoctrinate them.572 According to the Coalition
Against Involvement of Children and Youth in Armed
Conflict (COALICO), other cases of recruitment activities by armed groups in schools were reported in the

128

departments of Antioquia, Arauca, Bolívar, Caldas,
Cauca, Chocó, Nariño, Norte de Santander, Putumayo,
Sucre and Valle del Cauca.573 According to the national
Ombudsman, also in 2012, in Tierradentro,
Cauca, young children and teenagers were used in
surveillance and intelligence work for Águilas Negras,
as well as to recruit other children by offering bribes in
educational institutions.574
COALICO reported that paramilitary successor groups
waited outside schools to talk to children, find out
information, and recruit and control them.575 COALICO
also reported that armed groups used school students
to run their drug business inside schools which in
many cases led to children being recruited by the
group. Boys and girls were also used as spies or to
transport arms or pass on messages to other students
in schools.576

Attacks on higher education
Paramilitary successor groups and guerrillas
threatened students and student and university
leaders as they sought to exert influence over
university campuses.
Attacks on higher education facilities
According to media reports, in May 2010, 50-60 armed
persons in ELN uniforms entered the central square of
the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogotá, and
made a political speech.577
Attacks on higher education students, academics
and personnel
Four university students were murdered between
March and May 2009, according to a report by the UK’s
National Union of Students (NUS), University and
College Union (UCU), and Justice for Colombia.578 The
victims included Enrique Sierra, a student of ethnic
education of the University of La Guajira who was
active in the Association of Colombian University
Students. He was shot in the head by motorcyclists
while he made his way to university on 9 March
2009.579 NUS, UCU and Justice for Colombia reported
three additional cases between March and May
2009.580
Also in March 2009, 30 student leaders from the
University of Antioquia were threatened in an email

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

signed by the ‘Bloque Antioqueño de las
Autodefensas’. The students were told to leave the
university and the region or face assassination.581
A UNHCR report issued on 27 May 2010 said that
college and university professors viewed as politically
active faced risks to their safety.582
In 2011, the Santos government drew up reform plans
which students feared would lead to further privatization of higher education but later withdrew them in
the face of widespread student-led protests.583 In
October 2011, the FARC allegedly sent messages to six
university leaders in the department of Antioquia
identifying them as ‘military targets’ for continuing
their classes during the ongoing strike by students
against the proposed higher education reforms.584 In
July 2012, the administrative body of the National
University of Colombia denounced threats which had
been issued to students who were looking into alternatives to the proposed higher education reforms.585

Attacks on education in 2013
Some 350 teachers were threatened586 between
January and September 2013, according to the
Ministry of Education, which was the highest number
threatened in any year during the 2009-2013 period
and represented a steep rise from 2012.587 According
to a report by the Early Warning System of the
Ombudsman in November, teachers in Córdoba
department faced continued intimidation by guerrilla
and paramilitary successor groups.588 In July, as death
threats spread through the municipalities of Sucre,
four teaching staff received text messages to their
phones, claiming to be from the paramilitary
successor group Los Rastrojos, stating that the
teachers ‘had been declared a military objective’.589 In
September, the government passed Decree 1782,
which sought to ease teacher transfers through more
detailed procedures. It also led to the establishment
of a committee to monitor the incorporation of
teachers into new schools.590

department, in an apparently intentional attack
attributed to the FARC. No injuries were reported. The
armed forces reportedly helped construct the school
in 2011 and the project received funding from the
American Embassy and the Caquetá government. The
military said the school was attacked in retaliation for
military operations against the guerrillas. Some locals
believed the guerrillas were against the US and the
army being involved in building schools in the region,
according to a report in El Tiempo newspaper.592
‘Invisible borders’ between territories disputed by
rival armed and criminal groups were a key cause of
school dropout in Medellín, according to the
Association of Instructors of Antioquia and the
Medellín human rights Ombudsman. On 20 February
2013, residents in Bello Horizonte and Villa Flora,
District 7, received an anonymous leaflet telling them
not to take their children to four specific schools
because there was going to be a war; as a result,
4,000 children missed school for a day.593 In certain
areas such as Villa Hermosa, District 8, Medellín, the
drop-out rate reportedly rose to nearly 40 per cent.594
In higher education, teachers and staff at the
University of Córdoba reportedly faced threats from
Los Rastrojos in April.595 On 14 June, professors at the
University of Antioquia went on strike to protest
against harassment by illegal armed groups within the
institution. The strike followed an incident the day
before in which 15 masked men reportedly broke into
lecturers’ offices and a laboratory, stole equipment,
raised a FARC flag and addressed a crowd of 200
students on campus about the peace process.The
university reported the presence of the FARC at the
institution. The Government Secretary of the
Department of Antioquia said 12 arrest warrants had
previously been issued against members of the
university community in 2013.596
In November, a paramilitary successor group
threatened to kill 11 students at the University of
Córdoba.597

Armed groups attacked four schools in the first half of
2013, affecting 67 students, according to COALICO.591
For example, on 1 February, a blast levelled dormitories and classrooms at Guillermo Ruiz Mejía
boarding school in Balsillas village, Caquetá

CôTe D’IvOIRe
In Côte d’Ivoire, armed groups and military forces
destroyed, damaged, looted or used almost 500
schools and universities during the 2010-2011 postelection crisis.598

Context
Civil conflict divided Côte d’Ivoire for more than a
decade and caused the deaths of thousands of
civilians. In 2002, a rebellion in the north led to a
military-political stalemate in which the rebels, known
as the New Forces, retained territory in defiance of the
government-controlled south. At this time, the
majority of teachers in the north fled and nearly all
primary and secondary schools there ceased to
function. Despite a 2007 peace agreement, few
teachers returned to the north and, as a result,
hundreds of thousands of children continued to miss
out on education.599
People hoped that the presidential elections, held in
October 2010 after repeated delays, would mark an
end to the conflict. But renewed violence erupted
when the incumbent president, Laurent Gbagbo,
refused to concede victory to the internationally recognized president-elect, Alassane Ouattara, after a
run-off vote in November 2010. Several months of
failed negotiations led to fighting that left some 3,000
dead and at least 500,000 displaced.600 During this
period, members of the Student Federation of Côte
d’Ivoire (FESCI) – a pro-Gbagbo militant student group
created in the 1990s – spread fear throughout the
education system by attacking students, teachers and
officials. The situation came to a head in April 2011
when pro-Ouattara forces overran the south and
captured Gbagbo in Abidjan, with the support of
French forces.
Gross primary enrolment was 90 per cent (2011), while
the rate of transition to secondary school was 49 per
cent (2011)601 and gross tertiary enrolment was 8 per
cent (2009).602 The adult literacy rate was 57 per cent
(2011).603

Attacks on schools
Attacks occurred throughout 2009-2012 but predominantly from late 2010 to mid-2011 in association with

130

the post-election crisis. The UN reported a total of 477
schools destroyed, damaged, looted or used by armed
groups and military forces during this period, although
it is not clear whether they were all targeted.604
Monitoring undertaken by the Côte d’Ivoire Education
Cluster indicates that a total of 224 attacks on
education facilities in 15 education districts took place
between January and June 2011,605 with at least half
occurring in Abidjan.606 Approximately 180 schools
were pillaged and 173 were destroyed, burned down or
damaged.607 Twenty schools were attacked by bombs
and eight were left with unexploded ordnance.608 At
least 23 administrative buildings were also
attacked.609 As of July 2011, an estimated 67,000
children were prevented from accessing schooling as
a result.610
Though 97 per cent of schools reopened by late April
2011, some 140,000 previously enrolled students had
not yet returned to school by July 2011.611 Teachers
were also still absent in a number of areas, with
almost 50 per cent missing from schools in Man and
Odienné one month after the crisis.612

Attacks on school students, teachers and
education personnel
From 2009 through the post-election violence,
members of FESCI created an atmosphere of fear and
intimidation in secondary schools and universities by
injuring and sometimes killing fellow students as well
as teachers and administrators, often with impunity.613
On 26 March 2010, for example, FESCI and the
National Student Union of Côte d’Ivoire of the
Dimbokro modern high school fought pitched battles
in Dimbokro. Eight FESCI members, armed with
machetes, attacked and killed a student in the city
centre. Four FESCI members were arrested by police
and schools subsequently closed for a period.614

Military use of schools
At least 23 school premises were used by armed forces
during the crisis, including three to store weapons and
four as collective graves.615 These occupations of
schools – especially in the west of the country – were
predominantly committed by the Republican Forces of
Côte d’Ivoire (FRCI), formerly the ‘New Forces’, who
fought for President-elect Ouattara. The FRCI typically

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

used primary and secondary schools as well as adult
education centres for relatively short periods of time
when occupying one village to launch attacks on
another,616 although in September 2011 five schools in
the region of Moyen Cavally were reportedly still
occupied by FRCI elements,617 and at least one training
centre remained occupied as of December 2012 after
having become a de facto military camp.618 The UN
also identified one incident where Liberian mercenaries and pro-Gbagbo elements had employed a
school for military purposes in the Yopougon neighbourhood of Abidjan.619
Following the end of the political crisis, military use of
schools decreased dramatically, with only two
incidents verified by the UN in 2012.620 However, the
military continued to erect checkpoints near primary
schools located in Touba, Ziriglo, Toa-Zéo and Keibly,
among other towns and villages, making schoolchildren vulnerable to attack or intimidation by armed
elements.621

Attacks on higher education
Following the 2010 elections, attacks on higher
education increased as tension mounted between the
pro-Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara camps. Universities
quickly became embroiled in the conflict, with FESCI,
among others, operating alongside Gbagbo’s security
forces.622 On 30 November, for example, FESCI
members attacked pro-Ouattara students from the
University of Cocody623 campus in Abidjan, forcibly
ejecting some 50 students from their dormitories.624
A number of universities, including in Abidjan, Daloa
and Korhogo, were forced to shut down indefinitely.625
As fighting began, a university in Abidjan was transformed into an improvised military training camp for
pro-Gbagbo militia.626 Gbagbo supporters gained
control of most campuses in Abidjan.627 Hundreds of
young men received military training in schools and
university housing in 2011, typically conducted by
members of the Ivorian security forces, according to
accounts from the Abidjan neighbourhoods of
Yopougon, Abobo and Port-Bouët, the political
capital, Yamoussoukro, and the far western town of
Duékoué.628

Occupation and use of university facilities by forces on
both sides led to substantial damage, looting and
destruction. For example, in March 2011 during the
most intense period of hostilities, the University of
Abobo-Adjamé was first taken by pro-Ouattara forces,
and then by Gbagbo’s security forces.629 At least 70 per
cent of the campus was destroyed in the process,
including key academic records.630 After the postelection crisis, the Ouattara government temporarily
closed and renovated the country’s public universities, which had become hotbeds of violence and
militant politics, before reopening them in September
2012.631

Attacks on education in 2013
At the start of the 2013 academic year, at least two
university residences, Cité d’Abobo and Cité de PortBouët, were still occupied by the FRCI.632 A third, Cité
de Williamsville, had recently been vacated,633
following a government operation to restore public
and private property that had been occupied by force
during the post-election crisis.634

DeMOCRATIC RePUBLIC
OF THe CONGO
Attacks on schools, including widespread looting,
damage or destruction of facilities, and fear of
abduction and recruitment by armed groups
contributed to children missing out on education,
particularly in the eastern provinces.635

Context
Recurring conflict in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), exacerbated by the struggle to control
mineral resources in the east and south, has left more
than 5 million dead since 1997.636 A 2003 peace
agreement integrated many former belligerents into a
unified national army – the Congolese Army (FARDC) –
and created a power-sharing government, but conflict
continued in the east. Since then, the main protagonists have been the Congolese Army; the Hutu-led
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda
(FDLR); the Congolese Tutsi-led National Congress for
the Defence of the People (CNDP), which subsequently became a political party in 2009 and no

131

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

longer exists as an armed group; several other armed
‘local defence’ groups known as the Mai Mai; and,
from April 2012 to November 2013, the largely Tutsi-led
rebel group M23. The Ugandan rebel-group the Lord’s
Resistance Army (LRA) has also been fighting in the
north since 2006.637
School closures in conflict areas, damage of educational facilities, fear of abduction by armed groups
and widespread displacement have led to many
children and young people missing out on education
in the east.638
The country’s vast size and the remoteness of many of
the places where attacks occur, combined with
ongoing insecurity, make it difficult to accurately
monitor attacks. Many of the areas where they have
occurred are not accessible by road, and armed groups
are still in control. However, since the conflict began,
significant incidents of forced recruitment from
schools and along school routes, shooting or
abduction of students and staff, sexual violence
committed en route to and from school, looting and
burning of schools, occupation of education buildings
by military forces and armed groups, and persecution
of academics have been documented.639
In 2011, gross primary enrolment in DRC was 105 per
cent, gross secondary enrolment was 43 per cent and
gross tertiary enrolment was 8 per cent.640 Adult
literacy was 67 per cent in 2010.641

Attacks on schools
Attacks on education during 2009-2012 mostly
occurred in the eastern provinces, where rebel groups
and the Congolese Army were active. From October
2008 to December 2009, the UN reported 51 attacks
on schools by armed forces and armed groups.642 In
2010, at least 14 schools were attacked,643 while in
2011 the UN recorded 53 incidents against schools
and health centres.644 Of these, the FDLR was responsible for 21 cases of destruction and looting, and Mai
Mai groups for six, but the Congolese Army and the
Allied Democratic Forces-National Army for the
Liberation of Uganda (ADF-Nalu) were also responsible for some incidents.645
In 2012, the reported number of attacks increased
significantly, due mainly to fighting between FARDC

132

and M23 forces and the activities of other armed
groups who took advantage of the security vacuum
created by the army’s focus on the M23. At least 561
incidents of looting and damage, affecting 548
primary schools and 13 secondary schools in North
and South Kivu, were reported by local protection
monitors – although the percentage damaged during
targeted attacks or military use was not specifically
indicated, and not all cases could be confirmed.646 As
of March 2013, the Education Cluster had received 133
reports of schools affected by looting and damage in
North Kivu in which the presence or activity of armed
forces or armed groups was noted, including the
Congolese Army, the FDLR, the M23 and several Mai
Mai groups.647 During attacks on two schools in HautUélé district in January 2012, 10 classrooms were set
on fire by alleged LRA elements.648

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Two incidents of attacks on students or education
personnel were reported. On 4 October 2011, seven
education workers belonging to the Banyamulenge
ethnic group were killed near Fizi, South Kivu, in an
ethnically-driven attack by Mai Mai Yakutumba
fighters while on their way to lead a one-month
teacher training programme;649 and on 13 November
2012, shots fired by soldiers and police reportedly
killed four primary school students and injured nine
others in Kantine during a student march.650

Military use of schools
There was widespread military use of schools in 2012,
particularly as temporary barracks or bases. Schools
were occupied or used by the Congolese Army as well
as the FDLR, Mai Mai groups and other militia.651 In
Katanga province, where confrontations between Mai
Mai militias and FARDC were ongoing, some 64
schools were reported to have been occupied by
armed groups as of March 2013.652 Soldiers from the
Congolese Army reportedly occupied 42 primary and
secondary schools in Minova, South Kivu, and
Bweremana, North Kivu, for varying lengths of time653
from 20 November 2012 until at least 24 December,
preventing at least 1,100 children from going to
school.654 They used chairs and desks as firewood and

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

looted offices and stores, seriously damaging a
majority of the schools they occupied.655

istrative buildings and the deaths of a science student
and a security guard.663

Child recruitment and sexual violence at, or en
route to or from, schools

Attacks on education in 2013

A range of armed groups and the Congolese army have
recruited children and some of the recruitment has
taken place at schools. In April 2009, schools in the
northern Masisi-Walikale border zone were
temporarily closed in response to threats of
recruitment by Mai Mai forces.656 Ongoing recruitment
of children and threats of re-recruitment, including
from schools in Masisi and Rutshuru territories in 2010
by former CNDP elements integrated within FARDC,
were also documented.657 In November, ex-CNDP
FARDC members who refused to leave North Kivu
despite government orders reportedly visited schools
and demanded lists of recently demobilized
children.658 Between 19 April and 4 May 2012, M23
rebels forcibly recruited at least 48 boys around
Kilolirwe, Kingi, Kabati and other locations on the road
to Kitchanga, in Masisi, North Kivu province, according
to Human Rights Watch; some of them were recruited
at schools or on the way to or from school.659 On 19
April 2012, near Kingi, Masisi territory, M23 forces
rounded up at least 32 male students at Mapendano
secondary school.660
At least one incident of sexual violence was perpetrated on the road from a school. On 25 June 2009, a
Congolese army colonel in South Kivu allegedly raped
a 15-year-old girl on her way back from school, and
forced her to follow him on his redeployment after he
learned she was pregnant – although she eventually
managed to escape.661

Attacks on higher education
There were two reported incidents involving higher
education. In January 2011, university students
protesting insecurity on the campus of the University
of Kinshasa, following the murders of two of their
classmates, clashed with police. The university administration reported three deaths resulting from police
gunfire, though police said there were only injuries,
and several buildings and vehicles were looted or set
on fire.662 Student protests over tuition fee increases in
April 2011 also resulted in the damage of admin-

Destruction, looting and occupation of schools664 and
the presence of unexploded ordnance in and around
schools665 continued in 2013, as did the threat of
recruitment from schools and along school routes in
eastern DRC.666 As of late September, the UN had
documented at least 49 attacks on schools and health
facilities by armed groups.667 From 15 February to 18
March, the UN verified some six attacks on schools
and hospitals during fighting in North and South Kivu
and Orientale provinces.668 In March, UNICEF reported
that 18 schools had been systematically destroyed in
Katanga province.669 A joint investigation by the
United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO)
and local authorities in the Kamango area, Beni
territory, North Kivu, found that the armed group ADF
had ransacked 11 schools in July alone, destroying
school furniture; the group had attacked at least one
school in the preceding months.670 It also found that a
FARDC integrated brigade had temporarily occupied
five schools, burning the furniture as firewood.671
During clashes between armed groups in North Kivu
on 27 September, witnesses reported the kidnapping
of dozens of children and three teachers after their
school was burned down.672
University students and police clashed on at least two
occasions, one of which reportedly resulted in
casualties.673 In March, violence broke out at the
Institut Supérieur de Développement Rural in Lubao,
where students began protesting after a regional
administrator allegedly made derogatory remarks
about them on a local television channel. The police
claimed that warning shots had been fired on the
second day of protests but a student representative
said that the police had opened fire on the protesters,
some of whom were throwing stones, and had killed
two students and wounded at least five others.674

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

eGYPT
Political and sectarian tensions led to sporadic attacks
against schools, damage and looting of university
buildings, and arbitrary arrest and injury of students
on campus.675

Context
On 11 February 2011, President Hosni Mubarak was
ousted following a popular uprising, and after oneand-a-half years of military rule, Mohamed Morsi of
the Muslim Brotherhood was elected President.
However, in July 2013, the military deposed him,
leading to a violent crackdown on his supporters.
Security forces killed more than 600 pro-Morsi
protesters during the dispersal of two Cairo sit-ins on
14 August 2013.676 Sharp divisions, especially between
Islamists and secular groups, continued to result in
violent confrontations.677
Under Mubarak, there was a history of staff and
students at universities being closely monitored by
plainclothes state security on campus.678 In October
2010, an administrative court ordered security forces
off university campuses.679
Egypt’s net primary enrolment was estimated at 96 per
cent (2011),680 gross secondary enrolment was 72 per
cent (2010)681 and gross tertiary enrolment was 29 per
cent (2011).682 The adult literacy rate was 72 per cent
(2010).683

Attacks on school students, teachers and education personnel
In February 2012, a court in the southern city
of Assiut sentenced Makarem Diab, a Christian school
teacher, to six years in prison on charges of defaming
Islam. 684 The case against Diab was brought by
Islamist colleagues who accused him of mocking
Islam’s prophet Mohammed.685 In September 2012,
Nevine Gad, a Christian social studies teacher at a
preparatory school in Manfalout, Assiut province, was
arrested and charged with blasphemy after a student
complained about a lesson on Islamic history she had
given, with a section on the life of Mohammed.686

Military use of schools
In November 2012, the Lycee Al-Horreya ‘Bab El Louk’
sustained heavy damage when Central Security
Forces, Egypt’s riot police, used the school to launch
attacks on protesters in Cairo over four consecutive
days. Molotov cocktails left parts of the school in
flames and soldiers threw school furniture at
protesters.687

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education facilities
On 6 February 2011, in an attempt to quell protests,
the Egyptian authorities closed all universities. The
American University was damaged during protests in
November 2011.688
During December 2011 clashes, in which the military
opened fire and protesters threw Molotov cocktails,
the Egyptian Institute, a research institution, was
destroyed by fire and its invaluable collection of books
and journals largely destroyed.689 The government
accused protesters of throwing petrol bombs at the
building.690
Attacks on higher education students, academics and
personnel
Protests, clashes and arrests related to the wider
political unrest frequently took place on university
campuses. On 6 April 2009, eight people were injured
and 15 were arrested in clashes between opposition
and pro-government students during a protest in Ain
Shams University in Cairo.691
In early September 2012, hundreds of Egyptians
protested in Alexandria over the alleged torture by
police of a student who was arrested while participating in a demonstration at Alexandria University.692

Attacks on education in 2013
Schools and universities were affected by the many
political protests that turned violent in 2013. Pro- and
anti-Morsi demonstrators clashed around Cairo
University on 2 July.693 Witnesses reported gunmen
shooting from the top of the Literature Faculty and
other university roofs.694 Protests just outside the
university campus were ongoing for two months,
before being violently dispersed by security forces on
14 August.695 In September and October protests took

135

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

place on several campuses. Twelve people were
wounded at Ain Shams University.696 Twenty-three
were injured in clashes at Zagazig University between
students or between students and residents for and
against the Muslim Brotherhood: 15 in an incident of
fighting between students697 and eight in an incident
of fighting between students and residents.698 On 20
October, 55 students were arrested after they tried to
take their protest onto the streets from the campus of
Cairo’s ancient Al-Azhar University.699
Unrest also affected schools in central Cairo. In
January, the Al-Howeiyaty Secondary School for Girls
was burned down and the Lycee Al-Horreya was set on
fire in violent clashes between demonstrators and
security forces.700
A number of Christian schools were attacked during a
wave of sectarian violence that targeted Christian
churches and property across the country – predominantly in Upper Egypt – immediately following the
events of 14 August. For example, in Minya city, the
Coptic boys’ school complex and the Saint Joseph’s
girls’ school, among other Christian buildings, were
attacked and set on fire on 14 August.701 The same day
in Bani Suef, 125 kilometres south of Cairo, a mob
looted and set fire to a Franciscan girls’ school.702
With the start of the new academic year, a number of
student supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood led
protests or called on fellow classmates to boycott
schools, rallying against what they called a ‘military
coup’. Several students were arrested, including
seven high school students in Fayyoum during a
student-led protest in September and another two
high school students in Marsa Matrouh who were
distributing flyers calling for students to boycott
school in protest.703
One Christian school teacher, Demyana Abdelnour,
was arrested in May 2013 for blasphemy and ordered
to pay the equivalent of more than 25 years of her
salary after being accused by students of expressing
disgust when speaking about Islam.704

eTHIOPIA
Arbitrary arrest, ill-treatment and torture of university
students, particularly of Oromo ethnicity, were
documented, as were surveillance and intimidation of
teacher trade unionists.705

Context
Since the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary
Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of ethnic-based
parties, came to power in 1991, students – particularly
Oromo students who are actual or perceived
supporters of the insurgent Oromo Liberation Front
(OLF) or of registered Oromo political parties – have
frequently been the targets of excessive use of force by
state security, as well as arbitrary arrests and
mistreatment in detention.706
Since disputed elections in 2005, the government has
increasingly curtailed all forms of freedom of
expression, association and assembly, and arrested
members of the opposition.707
In 2008, the Ethiopian Teachers’ Association was
replaced by a pro-government union following the
killing of its deputy secretary-general, the imprisonment of other officials, and the detention and
torture of activists.708
Net primary school enrolment was estimated at 78 per
cent, while gross secondary enrolment was 36 per
cent and gross tertiary enrolment was 8 per cent
(2011). Approximately 39 per cent of adults were
literate (2007).709

Attacks on schools
One primary school was reportedly attacked in Badme
in June 2012 by the Eritrean army – seemingly in
response to Ethiopian military attacks in Eritrea.710

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
In February 2009, police shot and killed one student,
wounded another in the chest and arrested two more
during protests at Gedo Secondary School in West
Shoa zone, Oromia.711
Teacher trade unionists were subjected to surveillance
and harassment by government security agents as

136

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

part of an attempt to discourage them from trying to
register an independent National Teachers’
Association (NTA). Previously, the government had
seized the assets of the former Ethiopian Teachers’
Association and given the name to a governmentappointed entity. As of the end of 2012, NTA members
had not received notification of any decision by the
Charities and Societies Agency on whether they would
be permitted to register the NTA.712
There were reports of teachers who were fired,
arrested or otherwise harassed by security officials
because they refused to become EPRDF members,
were outspoken about political activities, or refused to
monitor the activities of their students for security
officials.713
In 2011, during the implementation of the Gambella
Region’s ‘villagization’ programme, students were
forced to go to neighbouring villages and build tukuls
(huts) for the new villagers. Students who refused
were not permitted to sit their year-end examinations.
Teachers who refused to organize students for this
activity were suspended or arrested.714

Investigation Sector, a detention centre also known as
Maekelawi, between 2011 and 2013.720
Throughout Ethiopia, students were detained by
security officials for organizing student associations,
being politically outspoken or organizing cultural
movements. The monitoring of students was one of
the key methods through which rural Ethiopians,
particularly Oromos, were targeted because of
involvement in lawful political movements. There were
anecdotal reports of Oromo students being released
from detention and not being allowed to complete
their schooling.721
In January 2010, Oromia police shot two unarmed
students, one fatally, during a disturbance at Ardayta
College; one policeman was found guilty of murder
and imprisoned.722
In June 2012, according to the HRLHA, security forces
stormed dormitories and arrested engineering
students at Haromaya University in Oromia to break up
a demonstration; they were held outside without food
for two days.723

Military use of schools

Attacks on education in 2013

During the Ethiopian military’s response to an attack
by unknown gunmen on a commercial farm in the
Gambella region in April 2012, soldiers used a school
in Chobo-Mender as a prison.715

Arrests of university students continued in 2013, with
at least three incidents reported.724 Security agents
reportedly arrested and detained some 100 Addis
Ababa University students, a majority of whom were
Oromo, after a violent clash erupted between two
groups of students on the Arat Kilo University Campus
(College of Natural Science) on 2 January.725 It was
reported that a number of these students were injured
and several had to be hospitalized.726 The clash was
said to have been triggered when Tigrean students put
up posters with insulting messages about Oromo
students.727 Police reportedly surrounded the campus
and detained at least 100 more students of Arba
Minch University in May who were said to have been
responsible for organizing a protest over educationrelated grievances.728 One Addis Ababa University
student was also arrested on campus in March after
expressing concern via Facebook about alleged
corruption among Arba Minch University officials and
city administrators; he was subsequently charged with
criminal defamation.729

Attacks on higher education
The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization,
in its April 2009 Universal Periodic Review submission
on Ethiopia, alleged that more than 80 Oromo
students from Bahir Dar University were arrested and
others were beaten in March 2009 during peaceful
protests.716 The Human Rights League of the Horn of
Africa (HRLHA)717 reported that a law student at Addis
Ababa University, who had been active in the Union of
Oromo Students, was arrested without a court warrant
in front of the main campus by security agents in July
2009.718 Amnesty International reported arrests of
students accused of supporting the OLF at the universities of Jimma, Haromaya and Nekemte in April
2011.719 Human Rights Watch documented arbitrary
arrests, torture and ill-treatment of a number of Oromo
students at Addis Ababa’s Federal Police Crime

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

INDIA
Some 140 schools were attacked by militants in
2009-2012, and there was widespread use of schools
as barracks or bases by government forces, mostly in
the east of the country.

Context
Most attacks on education occurred in states affected
by a long-running insurgency led by Maoist and other
left-wing armed groups – also referred to as ‘Naxalites’
– operating in at least 83730 of India’s 600 districts,
mainly in the east.731
While the Maoists claim they are fighting on behalf of
the poorest rural communities in each state, national
authorities say they are obstructing desperately
needed development initiatives. The exploitation of
natural resources and how the profits are distributed
are key issues of contention.732
Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Orissa were
among the states most affected by the conflict in
2008. As part of their insurgency, Maoists attacked
government infrastructure, including schools, police
stations and armouries, and used landmines and
improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to launch
attacks.733
Maoist attacks on schools and teachers and security
forces’ use of school premises in operations against
the militants have led to falling attendance and
increased drop-out rates, particularly among girls.
They have also reduced the quality of education
provided to some of the country’s most disadvantaged
children.734
Pockets of tension fuelled by Hindu and Christian
extremists in some areas, particularly in the northeast, and low-level insurgency by separatists or terror
groups in several states, including in Jammu and
Kashmir, have also led to attacks on education.
Net primary enrolment was 93 per cent, gross
secondary enrolment was 69 per cent and gross
tertiary enrolment was 23 per cent (2011). The adult
literacy rate was 63 per cent (2006).735

138

Attacks on schools
The number of attacks by Maoists on schools declined
steeply over the 2009-2012 period from a peak in
2009.736 Human Rights Watch documented attacks by
Maoists on at least 36 schools in Jharkhand and 23
schools in Bihar during 2009.737 The number of attacks
appeared to increase in the run-up to Lok Sabha
(House of Representatives) elections from April to May
2009.738 The Home Ministry, in a 2011 report, cited a
total of 71 school attacks in 2009, 39 in 2010 and 27 in
2011 across Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh,
Bihar, Maharashtra and Jharkhand.739 It reported only
three incidents in 2012740 but the perceived risk of
attack remained – for example, a school in Balangir,
Orissa, was closed for 12 days in September 2012 after
a Maoist poster was found pasted on the school,
triggering fear among parents and teachers that
Maoists would attack.741
Maoists frequently cited use of school buildings by
security forces as the reason for attacking schools,
claiming them to be legitimate military targets.
However, Human Rights Watch research found that
Maoists had damaged or destroyed numerous schools
that were not actually occupied by security forces at
the time of attack.742 Some Maoists justified attacking
newly built schools because they believed they would
be used to house police carrying out operations
against them. In many reported cases, Maoists also
claimed to have attacked a school because it was
previously rather than currently used by police.743
Maoists tended to attack at night, often using cans
packed with explosives – though, in at least one case,
insurgents set fire to a school’s two generators.744
Destruction from these explosions ranged from minor
structural damage to the collapse of entire structures.745
For example, in one incident on 9 April 2009, Maoists
blew up Belhara High School in Jharkhand. They
triggered two dynamite blasts in the evening, leaving
holes in the walls of two classrooms, a hole in the first
floor and cracks around the building, making it unsafe.
It was the tenth government building destroyed in a
week during the run-up to elections on 16 April.746
Following the attack, one or two dozen fewer students
attended the school and some classes had to be taken

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

on the school verandas because of the damage.747 In
another incident, on 14 April 2009, a witness told
Human Rights Watch that Maoists planted mines in
Gosain-Pesra Middle School, Bihar, and blew them up
remotely, causing half of the two-storey structure to
collapse to the ground.748
Seven incidents targeting Christian schools were also
reported, primarily by Christian sources, five of them
allegedly perpetrated by Hindu militants.749 For
example, on 26 January 2009, a group of Hindutva
activists attacked St Mary’s School at Kadiri in Andhra
Pradesh, destroying the furniture and injuring several
of the nuns, purportedly because the school had not
hoisted the national flag on Republic Day.750 Others
were attacked, apparently by Muslim protesters. On 16
September 2010, it was reported that one Christian
school in Jammu and Kashmir, the Tangmarg branch of
Tyndale Biscoe school, was razed to the ground,751 and
another, the Roman Catholic Good Shepherd High
School at Pulwama, was burned down during protests
over alleged desecrations of the Koran in the United
States.752

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
A tally of incidents reported by media and human
rights groups indicates that at least 13 teachers,753 one
catering staff member754 and four students755 were
killed from 2009 to 2012. At least 73 teachers756 and 11
students757 were injured. Seven teachers were
abducted, five of whom were subsequently found
dead,758 and at least two students were kidnapped.759
Maoists were suspected in a number of attacks on
teachers and the killing of at least four students.
Motives were not always clear but often the Maoists
alleged that their victims were police informers. In
several cases, it appeared that the teachers were
targeted after refusing to cooperate in some way: for
example, by declining to send their students for
Maoist training, refusing to pay levies to the People’s
Committee against Police Atrocities (PCPA) or
removing black flags hoisted outside their schools by
Maoists on Republic Day.760 In one illustrative
incident, the head teacher of Indiraboni primary
school in West Bengal was reportedly gunned down by
three Maoists on motorcycles amid claims that he had

prevented students from taking part in rallies
organized by Maoists.761 A number of teachers also
seemed to have been targeted because of their affiliations with the Communist Party of India–Marxist
(CPI-M). Many teachers refused to work in areas
affected by the Maoist conflict out of fear for their
safety.762
In at least two incidents, suspected Maoists were
reported to have killed individuals at schools in front
of students and teachers. On 14 September 2009, a
group of Maoists shot dead a teacher and CPI-M
member in Jamda High School in West Bengal after
entering the classroom where he was teaching.763 On
20 March 2009, a Class 9 student, and son of a police
officer who had been killed the previous year, was
fatally shot and then stabbed by Maoist guerrillas in
front of students at his school in Koyalibeda, in
Chhattisgarh.764
One media outlet said in August 2012 that children in
Maoist-affected areas of Jharkhand’s East Singhbhum
district were carrying bows and arrows to school,
fearing attacks from the insurgents. Local people had
been training children to defend themselves because
the children had to travel two kilometres to school
through thick forests.765
Several abductions and killings of teachers by
militants from separatist groups were reported in
Assam, in most cases after teachers refused to give in
to demands for money.766
In at least six incidents767 reported by Christian
sources, staff or students at Christian schools were
said to have been injured or threatened. For example,
on 29 May 2009, Hindu militants allegedly attacked a
Christian missionary school in Andhra Pradesh,
beating several teachers, telling them not to work in
the village and threatening to kill them.768
In Jammu and Kashmir, when schools reopened in the
Kashmir Valley in late September 2010 after a threemonth closure following violence and curfews,
separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani reportedly
called on parents not to send their children to school
and appealed to teachers to stay at home as part of a
political protest against alleged civilian deaths during
security operations. The chief minister of the state,
Omar Abdullah, appealed to separatists not to target

139

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

schoolchildren for going to school and many students
turned up for classes. However, at one school only 100
of the 3,000 pupils turned up amid threats of further
violence,769 and when protests began some schools
sent children home because they feared for their
safety. Supporters of the separatist movement
Hurriyet attacked school buses carrying children to
schools. For example, on 7 October 2010, at least
three students from a private school in Rainawari,
Kashmir, were reportedly injured when a school bus
was attacked by protesters throwing stones at it. On
the same day, protesters pelted a school bus in Soura,
but no injuries were reported. In a later incident in
December 2010, Hurriyet supporters ordered a driver
and student off a school bus and set it on fire.770

Military use of schools
During 2010, more than 129 schools were used as
barracks or bases across the country, particularly in
Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, but also in the
country’s north-east, in Tripura, Manipur, Nagaland
and Assam, disrupting education for an estimated
20,800 students.771 In the same year, some security
forces began complying with government and
Supreme Court directives to vacate schools.772
However, security forces continued to use schools into
2012 and 2013.773
According to a 2009 report by Human Rights Watch,
police and paramilitary forces occupied school
buildings with no prior notification, either temporarily
or for extended periods ranging from six months to
three years, during their counter-insurgency operations. Some educational facilities had been occupied
for over a decade.774 In many cases, security forces
took over entire school facilities and campuses,
completely shutting down schools, while in others,
they occupied only a part of the school, forcing classes
to continue in crowded quarters and alongside armed
men.775

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education occurred during 20092012, but they tended to be isolated incidents, most
often linked to students’ and academics’ political affiliation or activism. One professor at Manipur University
was shot dead on campus in May 2009, allegedly

140

By 2010, a squad of Indian paramilitary police had been stationed
inside the Tankuppa High School for four years after the local
police station was bombed and destroyed by Maoist guerrillas in
2006. Tankuppa, Gaya district, Bihar state, India.

because he was the leader of a clique trying to usurp
power within the university. An ethnic Meitei terrorist
group known as Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup, which
launched an ‘anti-corruption’ campaign in 2001 to
‘clean up’ the education system in the north-eastern
state of Manipur, claimed responsibility for the
attack.776
Two student trade unionists, including the speaker of
the Sumi Students’ Union and the former president
and advisor to Kiphire Sumi Students’ Union, were
shot and injured by National Socialist Council of
Nagaland-Khaplang militia in Dimapur on 2 May
2009.777

Attacks on education in 2013
There were isolated reports of attacks on schools by
suspected Maoist fighters778 and of recruitment of
schoolchildren to their ranks,779 although it was not
clear whether this happened on school premises.
Minority and marginalized communities continued to
suffer violence in education settings. In one incident,
at least 20 masked men broke into a Christian school
and abducted and raped four girls belonging to the
Pahariya tribal group, aged 12 to 14, although it was
not clear if the motive was sectarian.780 One report
highlighted the continued siting of paramilitary camps
next to schools, this time in Kashmir, and suspected
military use of the school in question.781

INDONeSIA
Religious intolerance and tension between religious
groups have led to attacks on schools attended by
minority Muslim sects and Christian schools in
particular.782

Context
Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population,
including a range of Muslim sects; there are also other
religious denominations and many ethnic groups.783
There are demands for independence in some
provinces and threats from an Al-Qaeda-linked
network, Jemaah Islamiyah.784 To combat this, the
state has targeted religious militants.785
Net primary enrolment was 94 per cent, net secondary
enrolment was 75 per cent, and gross tertiary
enrolment was 27 per cent (2011). Adult literacy was
93 per cent (2009).786

Attacks on schools
At least a dozen attacks on schools attended by
minority Muslim sects – Ahmadiya, Shia and Sufi –
and on Christian schools were reported by media and
human rights sources in 2009-2012.
In 2011, during a mob attack on Ahmadiya followers in
Cisalada, militants burned down homes and
schools.787
On 15 February 2011, approximately 200 militants
attacked an elite Shia boarding school for kindergarten to high school students in Bangil, East Java,
throwing stones, smashing windows and destroying a
guard post. The attackers left after the police fired
warning shots, but the incident left nine students
injured.788 There were four more attacks on the school
in 2010 and 2011. In one incident in 2010, bullets hit
the windows of a female dormitory. In two incidents in
February 2011, the female dormitory was stoned,
damaging the ceiling.789
On 29 December 2011, Sunni militants attacked the
Shia community in Nangkernang hamlet, reportedly
burning a religious school (madrassa) in addition to
several houses.790
Five Catholic schools were attacked by young Muslim
extremists. One of the assaults, on St. Bellarminus

Catholic School in Bekasi in May 2010, was reportedly
in retaliation for perceived ‘blasphemous’ comments
on a blog.791 On 8 February 2011, a Catholic school
complex was destroyed in Temanggung by an angry
mob. Police believed the attack was the result of
rumours spread by text messages that the defendant
in a religious blasphemy case would be given a light
sentence.792 In January 2012, three Catholic schools in
Yogyakarta, Central Java, were attacked, one by a
group of 25 militant Muslims. An investigation found
that the motive was an alleged anti-Islamic posting on
Facebook, but that it had been posted by someone
falsely claiming to be a student at one of the
schools.793

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Two people were killed and at least six were injured in
a Sunni attack on a group of students and teachers
from a Shia boarding school in Bangil, East Java, as
they returned to school via minibus after visiting their
families in Sampang, East Java, on 26 August 2012.
Around 500 machete-wielding men were involved in
the attack.794 Later that year, Sunni militants attacked
a Sufi learning house in Jambo village, Bireuen
regency, Aceh, and killed Teungku Aiyub, the leader of
the house, allegedly because he was a heretic. A
student-cum-assistant also died in the attack.795

Military use of schools
A police raid in November 2012 on Darul Akhfiya
School in Nganjuk, East Java, found rifles, ammunition
and a cleaver. Police said they suspected the school
was training Islamist militants.796

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

Attacks on higher education
The director of the National Counter-terrorism Agency
claimed in November 2010 that there had been an
increase in religious extremism among university
students and that a growing number of individuals
engaged in terrorist activity were being indoctrinated
on college campuses. A study by Islamic scholar Zulfi
Mubarak from Malang Islamic State University said
recruiters targeted science and engineering students
to make explosive devices.797
In August 2012, one student was reportedly killed
during a raid by police, army and counter-terrorism
personnel on Cenderawasih University, Abepura. A
further 11 students were reportedly held by police and
some were tortured. One possible reason for the
attack was that the students came from the same
tribal group as many members of the non-violent
campaigning group, the West Papua National
Committee.798

Attacks on education in 2013
Isolated incidents continued in 2013. According to a
Human Rights Watch researcher, in March a Sunni
mob destroyed the gates of the Al-Mujahadah
Foundation, a Sufi madrassa in southern Aceh, while
police reportedly stood by; in July, a dormitory of the
same school was burned down and a month later its
compound wall was reportedly destroyed.799 The gates
were destroyed on the same day that the South Aceh
regency government ordered students to leave the
facility in response to a ruling by Aceh’s Ulama
Consultative Council that its teachings were ‘false’.800
On 6 August, a petrol bomb was thrown at a Catholic
high school in Jakarta, an act that may have been
timed to coincide with the end of Ramadan.801

144

IRAN
Some students were killed when security forces raided
university dormitories. Other students and academics
were arrested, imprisoned or sentenced to death on
charges based on confessions obtained under torture.
Academics specializing in nuclear physics and
engineering were assassinated.802

Context
The reporting period witnessed many protests against
the government’s attempts to block reformists from
power. The protests, in which students played an
important role, were sparked largely by the controversial re-election of conservative Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad as president in June 2009. The subsequent suppression of protesters led to a large
number of human rights violations,803 with journalists,
students, academics and political activists
imprisoned.804 Further protests erupted in 2011, partly
influenced by the Arab Spring.805 Iran’s security forces,
apparently supported by the justice system, repressed
the dissent with methods that included arbitrary
arrest, imprisonment and torture.806
Failure to use due process led to extreme cases of
injustice, including arbitrary execution. For instance,
in 2010, Farzad Kamangar, a Kurdish teacher with
alleged links to the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party
(PKK), was reportedly tortured while in custody and
was sentenced to death, and subsequently executed,
after a seven-minute trial in which no evidence was
presented.807
From 2007 to 2013, the Iranian authorities systematically discriminated against politically active students
by partially or completely banning them from higher
education.808 Independent student organizations
were also banned and faculty were purged,809 and the
social sciences and humanities curricula were
restricted.810 In total, at least 250 students and
professors were expelled from April 2005 to March
2013.811 According to a compilation of media and
human rights sources, from 2009 more than 200
university teachers were forced to retire each year,
reportedly because they did not ‘share the regime’s
direction’ or support the rule of the Supreme Leader.812

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Furthermore, followers of the Baha’i faith were barred
officially from attending higher education from 1979,
and from 2009 they were increasingly harassed in
schools by staff.813 Several Baha’is affiliated with the
Baha’i Institute for Higher Education – an alternative
online system of teaching set up because Baha’is
were barred from universities – were arrested.814 The
activities of the institute were declared illegal and its
diplomas and degrees were denied legal validity.815
The UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human
Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran said Baha’is face
institutionalized persecution and the government’s
own documents revealed a policy to deprive them of
education.816
The election of Hassan Rouhani as President on 14
June 2013 raised hopes of political reform, and
signalled an apparent thawing in relations abroad817
and a more liberal policy towards those in education
at home, including the reinstatement of some
students and professors.818
In 2011, net enrolment at primary school level was 100
per cent, while at secondary level it was estimated at
79 per cent. Gross enrolment in tertiary education was
49 per cent. The adult literacy rate was 85 per cent
(2008).819

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
According to Human Rights Watch, at least 39 teachers
were detained between January 2009 and October
2012 on charges related to national security, many of
them in connection with their activities as teacher
trade unionists. For example, 15 were imprisoned
because of their trade union activity, including
protests for higher wages.820 Some teacher trade
unionists received long and severe sentences.821 In
one case, the former head of the Mashad
Headteachers’ Union was sentenced to six years in
prison in 2009 on charges relating to his trade union
activity. The sentence was later reduced to two years,
but when he was due to be released he was tried on a
new charge of ‘creating public anxiety’.822

Attacks on higher education
In 2009 alone, there were at least 30 attacks on
universities and colleges, including campus raids and
arrests of students, faculty and staff.823
Attacks on academics and students primarily came in
the context of anti-government protests. However,
there was also a pattern of targeted killings of those
specializing in physics and engineering. Iranian
officials alleged that these incidents were perpetrated
by foreigners and related to the development of the
country’s nuclear capacity. Among these, on 12
January 2010, a remote-controlled bomb placed on the
motorcycle of Massoud Ali-Mohammadi, 50, a
physicist at Tehran University, detonated outside his
apartment as he was heading to work, killing him
instantly.824 This was followed by similar assassinations of Majid Shahriari, a nuclear engineer at Tehran
University, on 29 November 2010 and academic
Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan on 11 January 2012. Another
nuclear physicist, Fereidoun Abbasi,was wounded on
29 November 2010.825 Further, on 23 July 2011, two
gunmen on motorcycles killed a student who was
studying for a master’s degree in the field of electrical
engineering at Nasir al-Din University in Tehran and
working with the Ministry of Defence.826
Students were killed,arrested, imprisoned and
sentenced to death in connection with antigovernment protests in 2009. Some of these incidents
took place during student association activities or on
campus.827 Days after the disputed 2009 election,
security forces assaulted students in several
provincial towns including Shiraz, Isfahan, Tabriz,
Bandar Abbas and Mashad.828 In one incident, on 14
June 2009, around 300 riot police and Basij forces
armed with guns raided Tehran University’s dormitories, resulting in the deaths of at least five students
and 133 arrests.829 One witness told The Guardian that
police issued a warning on loudspeakers saying: ‘If
you evacuate the building, we won’t harm you.
Otherwise you will all be injured or killed.’ When the
students came out with their hands on their heads,
the police beat them with batons.830
In several cases, students or academics were
executed after being convicted on spurious charges or
confessing under duress. One charge known as

145

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

moharebeh (‘enmity with God’) has been defined very
broadly. For example, Mohammad Amin Valian, a 20year-old student who was active in the Islamic
Association, a student organization, was charged
with moharebeh and sentenced to death in February
2010 for his role in the post-2009 election protests.
His alleged crimes included shouting ‘Death to the
dictator’; being affiliated with the Central Council of
the Islamic Association of Damghan Science
University and statements published by them; and
organizing election debates at the university. He was
convicted based on evidence that included photos of
him at a demonstration in December 2009 throwing
rocks into an empty area.831 Following international
protests, the sentence was reduced to imprisonment
and a fine.832
After the 2009 post-electoral conflicts, cases of
prolonged detention without charge, arbitrary arrest
and sentencing of students and teachers for political
reasons continued to be recorded. In the three years
from March 2009, the Human Rights Commission of
the Iranian student association, Daftar Tahkim Vahdat,
identified instances of 436 arrests, 254 convictions
and 364 cases of denial of education.833 As of April
2012, some 31 students were still being held in
prison.834 The charges ranged from ‘putting up posters’
to attending an anti-government rally. Some were
given the additional sentence of ‘prison in exile’,
meaning they were sent to a distant prison.835
Omid Kokabee, a PhD student at the University of
Texas, was arrested while visiting his family in Iran in
2011 and was held for 15 months before being given a
verdict in a rushed trial in which no evidence was
presented, according to his lawyer. He was sentenced
to 10 years in prison for national security offences after
refusing to co-operate on scientific projects in Iran, his
lawyer said.836
Another student, Majid Tavakoli, was sentenced to
eight-and-a-half years after he spoke at a National
Students’ Day rally at Amirkabir University of
Technology in 2009.837 Charges against him included
‘participating in an illegal gathering’, ‘propaganda
against the system’ and ‘insulting officials’. Tavakoli
was convicted after an unfair trial, without a lawyer,
and was held for months in solitary confinement and

146

sent to Evin prison.838 He was released on bail in
October 2013.839
In early June 2011, following the arrest of many
lecturers,840 the Baha’i Institute of Higher Education
(BIHE) was declared illegal by the Ministry of Science,
Research and Technology.841

Attacks on education in 2013
In January, three teachers were among five founder
members of the Alhavar Science and Culture Institute
who had their death sentences suspended pending
new investigations. Their sentences had followed
false confessions made after being tortured,
according to the International Campaign for Human
Rights in Iran. Alhavar members organized poetry
nights and art classes for young Arabs at a location
belonging to the education and development ministry,
but the institute was banned after organizing demonstrations opposing discrimination against Arab
people in 2005.842
Following Hassan Rouhani’s election as president,
some measures against students were eased. In
September, the Ministry of Science announced that
student activists who had been expelled from universities after 2011 could resume their studies, but those
who were banned earlier remained barred.843

IRAq
More than 100 school students and dozens of
university students and academics were killed in
2009-2012, and there were numerous direct attacks
on schools. The targeting of students, teachers and
academics continued in 2013 with shootings and
bombings.

Context
Sectarian fighting put significant pressure on Iraq’s
education system in the years following the fall of
Saddam Hussein in 2003. Hundreds of academics
were assassinated844 and the Ministry of Education
recorded 31,600 attacks against universities and
schools.845
After Saddam Hussein’s regime was toppled, Iraq
eventually fractured along sectarian lines as proBaathist forces and Islamist insurgents fought the

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

US-led occupying forces and Sunnis and Shias fought
each other. The levels of violence fell significantly by
2009 as a result of three main factors: US funding for
militia comprised of Sunni tribesmen who had previously fought the US and Iraqi forces,846 a surge by US
troops that pushed Islamist militants out of contested
cities and provinces, and a Shia ceasefire.847 American
combat forces withdrew from the country during 2011.
However, education continued to be affected by
violence and sectarian divisions.
Bombings remained commonplace, particularly in
central Iraq, and armed groups, including Al-Qaeda in
Iraq (AQI) and Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), continued to
carry out acts of violence targeting academics,
security forces and government buildings.848 Violence
also escalated in 2013 between Shias and Sunnis,
partly provoked by the Shia-led government’s
perceived marginalization of Sunnis, but also due to
the growing strength of Al-Qaeda and other factors.849
In addition to the direct violence against education
institutions and targeted killings of university staff,
sectarian divisions shaped the higher education
sector, putting pressure on students and faculty of
opposing groups.850 Different sects controlled
different Iraqi cities including the universities located
in them.851 There were also claims that control over
particular universities was increasingly being handed
to political parties. For instance, it was reported that
Baghdad University had been ‘allocated’ to the Islamic
Supreme Council in Iraq, Al-Mustansiriya University to
the Sadr Group, and Al-Nahrain University to the AlDawa Party.852 These groups interfered in many
aspects of university life, including admissions,
hiring, course content and physical security on
campus.853 After the appointment in 2011 of a leading
member of the pro-Shiite Islamic Dawa party, Ali alAdeeb, as Minister of Higher Education, the education
ministry fired large numbers of former Baathists from
university faculties.854 Subsequently, complaints of
sectarian bias in appointments were presented to the
United Nations Human Rights Council.855
In addition, insurgent groups demanded changes to
the curriculum or tried to deny access to education to
students from targeted groups and often responded
with violence when their demands were not met.856

Net primary enrolment in Iraq was 89 per cent
(2007),857 net secondary enrolment was 44 per cent
(2007)858 and gross tertiary enrolment was 16 per cent
(2005).859 The adult literacy rate was 79 per cent
(2011).860

Attacks on schools
There were 56 documented attacks on school
buildings during 2009-2012. Five attacks on school
buildings or facilities were documented in 2009,
seven in 2010, 29 in 2011 and at least 15 in 2012.861
Methods of attack included suicide bombings, use of
improvised explosive devices (IEDs), mortar attacks
and gunfire.862 For example, on 24 September 2012 –
the second day of the new school year – a suicide
bomber drove his car laden with explosives into AlKifah primary school in Anbar province, killing five
children and injuring six others. The blast caused
severe damage to the school building.863
In addition, IEDs planted in the vicinity of schools
impinged on access to school services: 54 incidents of
IEDs affecting schools were reported in 2011 alone.864
In some incidents, the detonation of bombs outside
schools was linked to intentional efforts to damage
them. For example, on 1 March 2012, an IED exploded
in front of a secondary school in Kirkuk and a police
search revealed a second bomb in the school.865 In
other cases, IEDs were planted to attack passing
military targets but also put students and teachers at
risk. For example, an explosive charge hidden in a
rubbish bin went off near a primary school in the AlRashidiyah neighbourhood of northern Mosul on 25
March 2009, missing its passing US patrol target and
instead killing four schoolchildren and injuring seven
more as they were leaving the school to go home.866
Militia groups also stored explosives at schools. Six
schoolchildren were killed and 28 students and
teachers wounded at the Abaa Dhar primary school for
boys in 2009 when a cache of explosives hidden
underneath the school’s rubbish dump, allegedly by
militia groups, was accidentally detonated by the
head teacher while he was burning refuse.867
Armed groups threatened several girls’ primary
schools on different occasions by planting IEDs on the
premises, attacking the schools at night and leaving

147

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

threatening messages. In some incidents, schools or
students were targeted because of the ethnicity or
religious affiliation of the majority of the students,
particularly in areas such as Kirkuk, Salahaddin and
Baghdad.868

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
During 2009-2012, some 106 school students were
killed, 200 injured and 22 abducted; however, the
number of attacks on education was greatly reduced
compared to earlier years.869
Sectarian groups attacked students and teachers, in
many cases apparently due to their status as students
or teachers.
Although a UN respondent reported no school student
or teacher victims in 2009,870 there was one media
report of three female students wounded in an armed
attack in western Mosul, on 25 May 2009, when an
unknown gunman opened fire on them as they left
their school in the Tamouz neighbourhood.871
According to a UN respondent, in 2010, 49 school
students were killed, 26 injured and five abducted in
attacks on education.872 The UN Assistance Mission in
Iraq (UNAMI) separately reported that more than 10
school teachers and university professors were assassinated in 2010 in Baghdad, Kirkuk, Mosul, Al Kut
(Wassit governorate), Al Anbar and Diyala, although it
did not indicate how many of the ten were teachers.
The motives for many of the killings were not known.873
In 2011, 37 students were killed, 33 students injured,
and 13 students abducted, according to a UN
respondent.874 Twenty-seven school personnel or
education officials were killed or injured in incidents
that included IEDs and direct shooting, mostly in
Baghdad, Kirkuk, Ninewa, Salahaddin and Anbar. In
all these cases, armed groups, including Al-Qaeda in
Iraq and ISI, were responsible.875 For instance, on 11
December 2011, a bomb attached to a car carrying a
Ministry of Education official in Baghdad’s northern
Shaab district exploded, killing him.876 The same day,
a bomb attached to a teacher’s car injured him when it
detonated in the town of Muqdadiya.877
In 2012, 69 students were killed, 167 injured and four
abducted, according to a UN respondent.878 For

148

example, in Salahaddin governorate, two secondary
school students were killed and another wounded
when five masked armed attackers entered the
school, made their way to a specific classroom and
shot at the students on 22 April 2012. The UN reported
that according to local sources, including local police,
AQI was allegedly behind the attack, some mentioning
that AQI had attempted to recruit the victims before
the incident.879 The UN also reported that 19 schoollevel education staff were killed or injured in 2012.880
On 12 March 2012, a teacher from the Riyadh district,
south of Kirkuk, died when a bomb attached to his car
exploded.881
Roadside bombs along school routes also killed or
wounded a number of students and teachers,
although they were not necessarily targeting
education. In one incident, Baghdad high school
students travelling by bus from Sadr City to sit their
final examinations were caught in a roadside bomb
explosion in June 2009. Police said that three pupils
were killed and 13 people wounded, although the US
army said there was one dead and eight injured.882 On
10 January 2012, three boys were killed by a roadside
bomb while leaving their school in Yathrib, near
Balad.883
Throughout 2009-2012, there were also several
instances of arrest or harassment of students,
teachers and teacher trade unionists. Ibrahim alBattat, a leader of the Iraqi Teachers’ Union, was
arrested and then released on 22 February 2010 after
an eight-day detention for his involvement in strikes
and his refusal to divulge union members’ names.884
On 26 February 2010, a warrant was also issued for
Jasim Hussein Mohammed, the national leader of the
Iraqi Teachers’ Union (ITU), who was subsequently
arrested and released.885

Attacks on higher education
Almost 500 Iraqi academics886 were killed in the nine
years from the fall of Saddam Hussein to April 2012,
but the vast majority of assassinations occurred
before 2009. Since then, attacks on higher education
have continued at a much lower rate, with 26 killings
recorded by media and human rights groups from
2009 to 2012. In two cases in 2010, professors who
had recently returned to Iraq from exile were killed,

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

contradicting the higher education ministry’s claims
that it was safe for academics to come back.887 UNAMI
reported the separate killings of six academics and the
combined kidnapping of two professors in 2011.888 The
majority of those killed were shot or targeted by explosions caused by magnetic or ‘sticky’ bombs, often
placed under vehicles, or other devices planted near
the victims’ homes. However, at least one professor
was stabbed to death and another was hanged after
unidentified attackers stormed his house.889 In
another incident in July 2011, the Director-General of
Iraq’s Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific
Research, Dawood Salman Rahim, was reportedly
assassinated, along with his son, in their car in west
Baghdad’s Ghazaliya district by a group of unknown
armed men.890
A compilation of media and human rights reports
suggests that as many as 20 higher education
students may have been killed and 115 injured
between 2009 and 2011. Of those killed, most were
reported to have been shot, many in drive-by
shootings in which the perpetrators and motives were
not known.891
In 2010, at least 100 students were injured when a
convoy of buses, escorted by Iraqi forces and transporting college students from Christian towns and
villages in the Nineveh Plain back to classes at the
University of Mosul, was attacked.892 A car bomb
exploded as the first buses crossed a checkpoint
along the internal border between the semiautonomous Kurdish region and the rest of the
country. Shortly afterwards, another roadside bomb
went off.893 The area around Mosul University had
already experienced several attacks and threats of
attacks in 2009, which is why students travelled in
these types of convoys.894 The attacks on Christian
students were part of a spate of dozens of attacks
against Christians in Iraq in 2010.895 According to
Worldwatch Monitor, nearly 1,000 students stayed
away from class for the rest of the semester as a result
of the convoy attack.896
Students in Kirkuk and the northern city of Mosul were
repeatedly targeted.897 In another incident on 11
August 2011, five Shiite university students were shot
dead by a drive-by assassin on a motorcycle while they

were swimming.898 On 6 June 2012, another student
was killed by a magnetic bomb attached to a
vehicle.899

Attacks on education in 2013
School drop-out rates in 2013 were the lowest for a
decade, which the education minister said resulted
from better security, removal of armed groups,
rebuilding of schools and increased recognition of the
value of education.900 However, there was an upturn in
the level of general violence in 2013,901 approaching
the levels of 2008, and there were numerous reports
of attacks on education, including against school
students,902 tertiary-level students,903 teachers,904
academics905 and education ministry officials.906 There
were multiple accounts of teachers being targeted
individually and some reports of large numbers of
students being killed. For example, on 6 October 2013,
a suicide bomber drove a truck full of explosives into
the wall of a primary school playground in Tel Afar,
north-west of Mosul, and detonated them, killing at
least 12 pupils and their head teacher.907
Attacks on higher education institutions and students
and academics continued. In January, Dr Abbas Fadhil
Al-Dulaimy, the President of Diyala University, survived
an assassination attempt in which his convoy was hit
by the detonation of a roadside bomb, which killed
two of his bodyguards.908 Tikrit University was
repeatedly targeted. In March, a bomb went off on its
campus, injuring five students.909 In June, a suicide
bomber attacked the campus, killing a police
officer.910 Four university staff members were also
reportedly killed in a bomb attack in March north of
Tikrit, but it is not clear whether they were targeted as
university staff members.911 In the most serious
incident affecting students, two suicide bombers blew
themselves up inside and outside Habib al-Asadi
Shiite mosque in Baghdad in June 2013, killing 34
people and injuring 57 others. Most victims were
students from the nearby Imam Al-Sadiq University for
Islamic Studies who regularly attended the mosque for
midday prayers, although it is not known if they were
being targeted.912

Palestinian schools and universities were targeted with
air strikes, attacked by Israeli settlers and in some
cases used by Israeli armed forces as interrogation
centres or surveillance posts. Israeli schools were hit
by indiscriminate rocket fire.913

Context
Hundreds of incidents of attacks on education –
including killing and injury of students and teachers,
and damage to schools during fighting – were
documented in Israel/Palestine in 2009-2012 by the
UN. The great majority of incidents occurred in
connection with the Israeli military operations ‘Cast
Lead’ (27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009) and
‘Pillar of Defence’ (14 November 2012 to 21 November
2012) in Gaza, and with Israeli administrative and
military arrangements in Area C of the West Bank.
Palestine is comprised of the West Bank
(including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, with
Israel located between the two. Control of the land and
education systems is divided between different
authorities. The Israeli Ministry of Education is responsible for education in Israel, and the Palestinian
Ministry of Education and Higher Education, the
Hamas-run education ministry in the Gaza Strip, the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and
private providers run schools in the West Bank and
Gaza.
Attacks on education in the West Bank are largely
linked to territorial, administrative and security
arrangements. Following the Israeli-Palestinian
Interim Agreement (commonly known as the Oslo
Accords), it was divided into Areas A (Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) military and civil control), B
(PNA civil/Israeli military control) and C (Israeli civil
and military control, comprising more than 60 per cent
of the West Bank).914 Sources of tension and violence
include the expansion of Israeli settlements that dot
Area C, restrictions on Palestinian construction and
movement imposed by the Israeli military, violence
and intimidation by the Israeli military and the
violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers and Palestinian
militants and protesters.915 In particular, education is
adversely affected by restrictions on movement,
curfews, denial of building permits and the issuing of
150

demolition orders against schools, settler attacks on
schools and universities, and actions of Israeli military
forces.916
In Gaza and southern Israel, education suffers
primarily from active armed conflict between Israel
and the Hamas government, which violently ousted
the PNA from Gaza in 2007, and other Palestinian
factions.917 An ongoing back-and-forth pattern of
Palestinian rocket launches and Israeli artillery fire
and airstrikes has damaged schools primarily in Gaza
but also in Israel.
UNOCHA reported in July 2013 that 13 schools located
within the Access Restricted Areas in Gaza, established in 2000, had been damaged or had classes
disrupted by the enforcement of restrictions on access
in the area extending up to 1.5 kilometres from the
border with Israel. According to UNESCO, schools in
the restricted area have also been damaged by the
activity of Palestinian armed groups, some of whose
rockets have fallen short and hit schools in Gaza
during the reporting period.918
Israel’s closures of border crossings, limits on sea
access, and restrictions on access to land areas
limited the entrance of building materials and
prevented travel of Gazan students and education
staff.919 Moreover, Egyptian authorities imposed tight
restrictions on Palestinian students and education
staff crossing the border at Rafah, in southern Gaza.
Gazan authorities also limited students’ travel outside
the area.920
Conflict has also caused physical harm and
psychosocial distress to students and education staff.
In Gaza, during Operation Cast Lead, 265 students and
teachers were killed and 875 injured;921 during
Operation Pillar of Defence, 21 students and school
staff and teachers were killed and 343 injured. In both
cases, it is not known how many casualties resulted
from targeted attacks.922 In southern Israel, students
and staff face the constant fear of intermittent attacks
on civilian areas by unguided rockets and mortars
launched by Palestinians from Gaza, which have hit
schools and school transport, killing one student and
injuring another, and injuring a bus driver, during
2009-2012.923
The first Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in
three years restarted on 29 July 2013.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Net primary school enrolment in Israel was 97 per cent
and net secondary school enrolment was 98 per cent
(2010), while in Palestine, these figures were 87 per
cent and 81 per cent (2011) respectively.924 At tertiary
level, gross enrolment was 62 per cent (2009) in Israel
and 51 per cent (2011) in Palestine.925

involving the vandalizing of school buildings in the
West Bank by Israeli settlers were documented in UN
and media reports. On 21 October 2010, for example,
vandals alleged to be settlers set fire to a storage room
in a West Bank Palestinian girls’ school and left graffiti
on its walls.933

In both the West Bank and Gaza, educational
achievement has dropped in recent years, with
examinations showing a decline in overall results.926
In Israel, rocket attacks have caused thousands of
students to miss out on learning periodically.927

An Islamist Palestinian armed group claimed responsibility for setting fire to an UNRWA summer school for
Palestinian children in Beit Lahia in May 2010; and an
unidentified group of 25 armed militants set fire to a
similar summer school in Central Gaza in June 2010.934
One Palestinian rocket landed near an Israeli kindergarten in 2010.935

Attacks on schools
Both Israeli armed forces and settlers in the West Bank
and Israeli armed forces and Palestinian armed groups
in Gaza and southern Israel allegedly perpetrated
attacks on schools and other education facilities.
During Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009, at least 280
out of 641 schools in Gaza were reportedly damaged
and another 18 destroyed.928 It is not specified how
many were damaged in targeted attacks; many were
damaged during firing at Palestinian military positions
and training sites. Incidents during the reporting
period included the total destruction by aerial
bombardment on 3 January 2009 of the American
School in Beit Lahia, in the north of the Gaza Strip,
which Israel claimed Palestinian armed groups were
using as a firing position (this was disputed by local
residents and the school’s director);929 and damage to
the Beit Lahia Elementary School, an UNRWA school,
as a result of Israeli forces’ shelling with white
phosphorous, killing two boys and injuring 13 others
who were using the school as an emergency shelter.930
The impact of the destruction of schools was subsequently compounded by an ongoing blockade
imposed by Israel931 that restricted access to building
materials and other education supplies required to
repair the damage, resulting in substandard school
facilities, overcrowded classrooms and the underresourcing of educational activities.932
In 2009 and 2010, the UN reported instances of Israeli
forces being in schools following raids, forced entry,
and search and arrest operations. In some cases, tear
gas was used on students. The incidents resulted in
damage to schools, interruption of education and
placed students’ safety at risk. A number of incidents

In 2011, according to the UN, there were 46 incidents
of violence related to education.936 In six instances,
settler violence targeted schools in the West Bank;
these cases involved settlers throwing objects such as
rocks and bottles at schools, physically assaulting
children and teachers inside schools, and vandalizing
schools with graffiti and arson.937 In one case, Israeli
settlers set fire to a prayer room at a school in the
Nablus governorate.938
In 11 incidents during 2011, Israel Defence Forces (IDF)
fire in Gaza, targeting military installations or training
sites, damaged schools.939 Among these was an
UNRWA school, reportedly damaged by Israeli
airstrikes in December 2011.940 Two schools were
damaged in 2011 by Palestinian rockets aimed at
Israel, but which landed in Gaza.941 In one instance,
unknown masked and armed men attacked and
vandalized an UNRWA summer games facility.942
In 2011, there were 11 instances of IDF personnel
entering schools in the West Bank – with no reasons
given or known. In some of these instances, schools
were affected as a result of clashes occurring close to
them and tear gas canisters landing inside school
grounds.943 According to a UN respondent, in some
instances the IDF entered schools to ‘intimidate’ staff
and pupils against stone throwing.944
Also in 2011, there were four instances of indiscriminate rockets launched from Gaza resulting in damage
to schools in southern Israel. In one specific instance,
an anti-tank missile from Gaza hit a school bus and
killed a 16-year-old Israeli boy. It is not possible to
ascertain if any of these attacks was targeted.945
151

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

In November 2012, the Israeli military operation Pillar
of Defence, in which Israeli forces targeted military
installations and training sites, resulted in the
damage of more than 290 school buildings in Gaza,946
including 60 UNRWA school buildings.947 Rockets
launched by Palestinian armed groups during the
hostilities damaged six school buildings in seven
incidents in southern Israel.948 Schools in both Gaza
and southern Israel within a 40-kilometre radius of the
border with Gaza were closed as fighting intensified.949
The UN documented 27 additional incidents of
violence related to education in the West Bank in
2012.950 There were 21 instances of IDF personnel
entering Palestinian schools.951 Israeli military
personnel conducting security sweeps ahead of Israeli
settlers’ night-time religious events entered the Haj
Ma’zoz Al Masri Secondary School for Girls in Nablus
on six separate occasions.952 Eleven other times,
Israeli forces tried, sometimes successfully, to enter
school premises, often during search operations,
disrupting classes and sometimes damaging schools.
Israeli forces fired tear gas or live ammunition at
schools in another four instances in 2012.953 For
instance, on 13 November 2012, Israeli police
allegedly fired tear gas inside Aba Secondary Mixed
School, causing 29 students to seek medical
attention, after violence erupted when interior
ministry officials attempted to post demolition orders
for illegal building work.954
In 2012, Israeli settlers from the Yitzhar settlement
threw stones at the Palestinian school in Urif (near
Nablus) on four separate occasions. One incident, on
23 April 2012, triggered clashes between Palestinians
and Israeli forces and settlers during which teargas
was fired, injuring eight Palestinian children.955
Demolition and stop-work orders
In 2011 alone, Israeli authorities issued nine schools
in Area C of the West Bank with demolition or stopwork orders,956 bringing the total number of such
schools to 38, including several considered at
imminent risk, and affecting 4,300 children.957 Under
these orders, schools cannot be rehabilitated to meet
minimum humanitarian standards or can be demolished at any time.958 Such orders can represent a

152

denial of access to education or a threat to deny
access. A school in Khirbet Tana, near Nablus, was
demolished in 2010 for the sixth time by Israeli forces.
In Dkaika village, South Hebron, another was partially
demolished in 2011.959 In 2012, Israeli authorities
issued demolition orders against three Palestinian
schools in Area C and East Jerusalem for being built
without a permit.960 On 14 May 2012, Haaretz reported
that a Palestinian elementary school was shut down
after Israel’s Civil Administration confiscated the
vehicle used to transport teachers to it. The school
also had a demolition order against it, although the
nearest alternative school was 20 kilometres away.961

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
In southern Israel, in April 2011, an anti-tank missile
fired from the Gaza Strip struck a school bus, killing a
16-year-old boy and injuring the driver.962 It was not
possible to ascertain if it was targeted.963
Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the AlQassam Brigades, an armed wing of Hamas.964
In the West Bank, schoolchildren, teachers and other
personnel faced intimidation by Israeli settlers and
military forces. Out of 101 communities surveyed by
the Education Cluster and the Child Protection
Working Group in 2011, 28 experienced settler
violence against students and teachers and 26 experienced threats against them.965 In one case, at Qartaba
School in Hebron, there were reports of pupils and
staff being harassed or threatened. In October 2011, a
guard at the school was allegedly assaulted by a group
of settlers after he tried to stop them from throwing
glass and empty bottles at the building.966 In
December 2011, according to Ma’an News Agency,
settlers allegedly tried to stab a sixth-grade pupil at
the school and hit another who tried to defend him,
while Israeli soldiers allegedly looked on without
intervening.967 During the incident at a Palestinian
school in Urif in April 2012 (mentioned earlier in the
Attacks on schools section), in addition to throwing
objects at schools, Israeli settlers physically assaulted
children inside schools and on their way to and from
school.968
One-quarter of Palestinian communities questioned in
the 2011 Education Cluster and Child Protection

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Working Group survey also reported that schoolchildren, youth and teachers experienced Israeli
military harassment or violence while en route to and
from school, and 31 per cent indicated that students
and teachers had to cross at least one military checkpoint to reach their schools, which affected more than
2,500 children each day.969 Sixteen per cent of
children in the communities surveyed claimed to have
experienced delays and harassment by military and
security personnel while crossing these checkpoints
or the separation barrier.970

Military use of schools

year-old university student from Tulkarem city because
of his graduate research project on the construction of
a pilotless plane, which they said posed a threat to
Israel’s national security.979 One academic who called
for a one-state solution was detained without charge
by the Israeli authorities in 2011 and was still being
held two years later.980At least nine academics and
university staff were reportedly detained981 by the
Palestinian Authority – including eight from An-Najah
University accused of being affiliated with Hamas and
attempting to start a new university in the West
Bank.982

The UN found evidence of the military use of schools in
the West Bank in 2011 and 2012. For example, in March
2011, the Israeli military used a school in the village of
Awarta as a detention and interrogation centre for two
weeks after five members of an Israeli family were
killed, allegedly by Palestinian youths. 971 In April 2011,
Israeli forces broke into a Nablus school and went on
the roof to provide security to a nearby area that
settlers were visiting at night.972 In 2012, there were
two incidents of schools being occupied by the IDF.973
In one of the incidents, according to the International
Middle East Media Centre, Israeli soldiers used a
school east of Jenin city as a military post and
monitoring tower in November 2012.974

Palestinian students and professors experienced
restrictions on movement that negatively impacted
their educational activities, including a blanket Israeli
ban on travel for Gazan students and professors to
study or lecture at Palestinian universities in the West
Bank. In October 2009, the Palestinian interior
ministry and an NGO campaigning for freedom of
movement reported that 838 Gazan students who
were formally offered places and/or enrolled at foreign
universities were unable to leave Gaza because of
travel restrictions and bureaucracy.983 Hamas also
barred seven students from travelling to the United
States for a year of study under a US programme, citing
worries over their supervision.984

Attacks on higher education

Attacks on education in 2013

Higher education was affected by similar violence. In
Gaza, during Operation Cast Lead, 14 of the 15 higher
education institutions were damaged, with six directly
targeted, according to the Al Mezan Centre for Human
Rights in Gaza. Three colleges and six university
buildings were fully destroyed. The total damage was
estimated at USD 21.1 million.975 Seven universities in
Gaza were also damaged during Israeli airstrikes in
November 2012.976

A wide range of types of attack on education
continued to be reported in 2013. These included
demolition orders against primary and secondary
schools in East Jerusalem and the West Bank,985
settlers stoning schools and students986 and school
buses carrying students,987 acts of intimidation by
settlers, the use of tear gas in and near Palestinian
schools by Israeli police, and shootings of students by
Israeli soldiers.988 Police found military weapons and
explosives stashed in two schools in Israel.989 There
were also reports that the Ministry of Education in
Gaza was organizing military-style training for school
children aged 15-17, with training provided by the
Hamas National Guard and militants with Hamas’s
armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, and that the
Prime Minister was planning to extend it to 12-yearolds.990

University students and faculty were injured or
arrested by Palestinian and Israeli forces. In one
incident, Gazan police entered the campus of Al-Azhar
University in Gaza and attacked protesting students,
allegedly beating them with clubs.977 According to
media and human rights reports, Israeli security forces
arrested 20 university students from 2009 to 2012.978
For example, Israeli forces reportedly detained a 20-

KeNYA
Several students and teachers were killed by militants,
tribesmen or troops in sporadic attacks on schools or
attacks en route to or from school.991

Context
Kenya experienced post-election inter-ethnic violence
between December 2007 and February 2008 following
a dispute over presidential results. The conflict was
resolved by the establishment of a power-sharing
arrangement between the Opposition candidate, Raila
Odinga, and President Mwai Kibaki.992
During the violence, eight schools in the former Rift
Valley province were set on fire or looted.993
Although the formation of the coalition government
restored calm, inter-tribal disputes and banditry
affected education during the reporting period.
There was also growing concern about the activities of
Al-Shabaab, the armed group based in neighbouring
Somalia. Kenya accused Al-Shabaab militants of
launching a series of attacks in Kenya in 2011,
kidnapping and killing tourists and aid workers. 994 In
October that year, Kenya’s military entered Somalia to
try to counter the threat from the group, but the
incursion led to retaliatory attacks by Al-Shabaab in
Kenya, sometimes affecting schools and teachers.995
Net primary enrolment was 83 per cent996 and net
secondary enrolment was 50 per cent (2009).997 At
tertiary level, gross enrolment was 4 per cent
(2009).998 The adult literacy rate was 87 per cent
(2010).999

Attacks on schools
In June 2010, a five-kilogramme bomb was discovered
on the compound of Mwangaza primary school in
Isiolo.1000 On 26 May 2012, unidentified assailants
threw grenades at Horseed primary school in Dadaab
refugee camp, injuring five school construction
workers.1001

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
On 27 October 2011, a secondary school head teacher
and a government official were among at least four

154

killed when gunmen ambushed their vehicle 70 miles
from Mandera, near the Somali border.1002 In January
2011, a teacher from Gerille Primary School in Wajir
district was killed during an attack, causing teachers
to flee and the school to close for two months. The
slain teacher, Julius Gitonga, had been at the post for
less than a week.1003
Eight children were killed in a Kilelengwani village
classroom on 10 September 2012 during a raid
allegedly mounted by members of the Pokomo
community, an incident within a long-running dispute
between the Pokomo and Orma over pasture.1004
In November 2012 in Garissa, Kenyan soldiers
reportedly entered a school and shot at students while
they were waiting to go into an examination, injuring
two. The incident occurred as soldiers were searching
the area for attackers in the wake of the killing of three
soldiers in the town.1005
In March 2009, it was claimed that four education
officials from Wajir South district and a driver on their
way to a provincial primary school games tournament
in Mandera town were abducted, allegedly by AlShabaab militants.1006

Military use of schools
In September 2012, police sent to curb inter-tribal
violence reportedly created a camp inside a school in
Dide Waride.1007

Attacks on higher education
In March 2009, one student was shot dead during
demonstrations over the killing of two human rights
activists on the University of Nairobi campus, when
police employed tear gas and live ammunition.
Although Kenyan police said three officers were under
investigation,1008 no one had been prosecuted for the
killing as of 2013.1009 Kenyan police, however, have
regularly fired at protesting students.1010

Attacks on education in 2013
At least two attacks occurred along the Somali border.
In one incident in February, an IED was set off at the
Garissa primary school, where a campaign rally for a
presidential contender was scheduled to be held the
following day.1011 In another incident, a teacher was
among six people killed during attacks in Damajaley

and Abdisugow villages in May; the Kenya National
Union of Teachers subsequently asked teachers to
flee border-town schools for their safety in the
absence of adequate protection.1012 There were also
allegations that extremist groups were recruiting
young militants in Kenya, in some cases in schools
where students were reportedly being indoctrinated.1013

A library, an administration building and various
offices at Kamwero Primary School were also set alight
by bandits raiding villages in parts of Baringo county
in early April. At least nine schools in the area were
shut down as a result of these raids and more than
2,000 students reportedly dropped out of school.1014

LIBYA
More than 200 schools were used by armed groups
during the 2011 uprising against the Gaddafi regime
and more than 1,900 schools were damaged or
destroyed.1015

Context
Libya’s conflict began in February 2011 when protests
in Benghazi against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s
regime were crushed by security forces firing on the
crowd. This led to a rapid escalation between forces
loyal to Gaddafi and those seeking political and social
change. In March 2011, a NATO coalition intervened
with an air campaign following UN Security Council
Resolution 1973 and on 16 September 2011, the UN
recognized the National Transitional Council (NTC) as
the legal representative of Libya. The following month,
on 20 October 2011, Gaddafi was captured and subsequently killed by rebels.1016
In total, more than 1,900 schools were damaged
during the 2011 uprising,1017 of which 476 sustained
heavy damage and 19 were completely destroyed.1018 It
is not known how many of these were intentionally
targeted.
Fighting in 2011 caused extensive damage to universities in Misrata, while in June 2011, the Libyan
government said NATO bombing in Tripoli had
damaged university buildings.1019
A nationwide school-based survey, reporting conflictrelated causes of drop-out, indicated that a total of
338 pupils had been killed, 268 injured and 48
disabled during the war in 2011.1020
The priorities of the new Ministry of Education during
the transition period included curriculum reform,
clearing schools of unexploded ordnance and
repairing damaged infrastructure.1021
Gross enrolment rates in Libya were 114 per cent
(2006) at primary level,1022 110 per cent (2006) for
secondary1023 and 54 per cent (2003) for tertiary.1024
The adult literacy rate was 90 per cent (2011).1025

Attacks on schools
A total of 27 intentional attacks on schools were
documented in 2011, affecting more than 14,000

156

children, according to the UN, although it stressed
that this number represented only a portion of the
incidents that took place due both to difficulties in
gaining access to certain areas because of fighting
and the absence of systematic monitoring and
reporting. Most attacks were reported to have been
carried out by the Gaddafi government’s forces and
opposition forces led by the NTC.1026
A UN inter-agency assessment found that in Zlitan
between five and eight schools reportedly used for
military purposes were badly damaged and that
several schools that were allegedly being used for
military purposes were damaged by aerial
bombardment. An independent civil society factfinding mission visited a number of schools and
colleges targeted by NATO, including a number of
schools in Zlitan that it had been told were used by
pro-Gaddafi forces, but found no evidence of prior
military use.1027
In 2011, 89 schools reported unexploded ordnance on
their premises, affecting 17,800 students. This
problem continued into 2012.1028
Schools were used as polling stations during elections
to Libya’s General National Congress in July 2012,1029
which may be the reason that some were attacked by
armed militias.
The Ministry of Education reported attacks on at least
five schools that were being used as polling stations
during the elections in July 2012.1030 For instance, on 6
July 2012, a polling station in a school compound in
Benghazi was attacked by small arms fire and improvised explosives.1031

Military use of schools
According to a UN respondent, 221 schools were used
by armed groups during 2011, with a further 35 used by
the government or local administration.1032 The UN
respondent said both pro-Gaddafi forces and forces
aligned with the NTC used schools as military bases,
thus making them a target for attack.1033 At least one
school in Misrata, Al-Wahda High School, was used to
detain hundreds of prisoners and remained a
detention facility as of 2013.1034 During the revolution,
there was a pattern whereby rebels, when they
liberated areas, used schools as detention centres to

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

hold prisoners.1035 Schools were closed at the time.
Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) reported that
Gaddafi forces had also used an elementary school in
Tomina as a detention site where women and girls
were raped.1036

Attacks on higher education
In October 2011, forces of Libya’s interim government
seized control of two strategic areas in the city of Sirte,
at the university and at a huge construction site that
was meant to be its new campus.1037

Attacks on education in 2013
There were isolated reports of explosive devices being
placed inside or near schools1038 and fears that girls

were being abducted by armed men. On 28 September
2013, it was reported that four girls had been
abducted from outside schools in Tripoli, with at least
one incident involving armed men. Government
officials strongly denied a claim that up to 47 girls had
been taken in less than a week.1039 Nonetheless,
teachers staged a sit-in to demand increased security
outside schools.1040

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

MALI
Some 130 schools were looted, destroyed or used by
armed groups and government forces during fighting in
the north of the country, notably in 2012 and early
2013. The conflict caused widespread disruption of
education.1041

Context
Conflict erupted in northern Mali in early 2012 when
Tuareg insurgents began pushing for autonomy. A
military coup in March undermined the government’s
response to the conflict, leading to considerable
political instability,1042 and by April the armed groups
had consolidated control over the northern regions of
Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal.1043
The Tuaregs drove the Malian army out of the north in
April 2012, formed an alliance with armed Islamist
groups – Ansar Dine, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb
and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa –
and declared the area to be an Islamic state. Ansar
Dine began imposing strict Sharia law and the armed
Islamist groups soon turned on their Tuareg allies,
taking control of most of northern Mali’s cities.1044 In
January 2013, after the armed Islamists launched an
offensive southward, the Malian government asked
France for assistance in driving back the armed
groups. Within several months, the joint efforts of the
French, Malians and other African troops had largely
cleared the Islamists from their strongholds.1045
The armed conflict in the north caused hundreds of
thousands of civilians to flee, including most teachers
and school administrators, and temporarily reversed
gains in education access and quality.1046 In February
2013, 86 per cent of pupils remaining in the north were
still without education.1047 By October 2013, tens of
thousands of civilians had returned to the northern
regions but the conflict, large-scale displacement and
the accompanying disruption of schooling adversely
affected education for hundreds of thousands of
children.1048
In 2011, net primary enrolment was 71 per cent, net
secondary enrolment was 34 per cent and gross
tertiary enrolment was 7 per cent.1049 Approximately 31
per cent of adults were literate.1050

158

Attacks on schools
The Education Cluster reported in March 2013 that 130
schools had been occupied, looted or destroyed,
although it is not specified whether all of the latter
were targeted.1051 Schools throughout the north were
damaged while being pillaged, primarily by the Tuareg
insurgents, but also, to a lesser extent, by armed
Islamist groups and local populations.1052 Landmines
and unexploded ordnance located in and around
schools in conflict-affected communities also placed
thousands of children at risk and, in at least one case,
damaged a school in Bourem in 2012.1053

Military use of schools
In August 2012, NGOs reported that armed groups
were using 21 schools.1054 According to the UN, in
September 2012, military troops and pro-government
militia, notably the ‘Ganda-koi’, were using at least 14
schools in the region of Mopti, affecting 4,886
students.1055
Human Rights Watch identified 18 places, including
private, public and Koranic schools, where armed
Islamist groups were reportedly training new recruits,
including children as young as 11. For example, one
witness described seeing some 20 children both
studying the Koran and receiving weapons’ training at
a Koranic school in a northern town in July 2012.1056

Attacks on education in 2013
During the first part of 2013, French aerial
bombardment was reported to have damaged several
schools allegedly being used by armed groups1057
including one in Bourem, one in Douentza, one in
Timbuktu town and at least one other in Diabaly.1058 In
early January, a schoolyard shared by a primary school
and a secondary school in Konna was occupied by
Malian Armed Forces as they prepared for combat,
closing the schools for nearly a month.1059 Landmines
and unexploded ordnance located in and around
schools continued to place students and teachers at
risk.1060

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

MexICO
Teachers in more than 75 schools were threatened,
more than 50 students, teachers, academics and
education officials were killed or abducted with their
whereabouts unknown, and nanotechnology
researchers were targeted with bombs in 2009-2012.

Context
Attacks on teachers, academics and students took
place in the context of high levels of general violence,
including the abduction without trace of large
numbers of children and adults.1061 Heavily armed
criminal groups fought over territory and control of the
drug trade – the main source of heroin and cocaine
entering the United States – and against security
forces trying to dismantle them.1062 The drug cartels,
which have thousands of armed men, have increasingly diversified their operations, turning to other illicit
trades such as kidnappings and extortion. The federal
government began intensive security operations
against them in 2006, backed by 96,000 troops.1063 In
the course of counternarcotics operations, security
forces committed widespread human rights violations, including killings, torture and forced
disappearances.1064 According to the government,
more than 70,000 people were killed in drug-related
violence from December 2006 to December 2012, and
more than 26,000 more were victims of disappearances or otherwise went missing.1065
Teachers were among a long list of targets, reportedly
because of their regular salary.1066 Parents and
children were attacked at schools and police were
targeted while trying to protect educational establishments. In many cases, there was insufficient evidence
to establish who was responsible for the attacks
because few crimes were properly investigated by the
authorities.
In primary education, net enrolment was 96 per cent in
2011 and in secondary education it was 67 per cent;
gross enrolment at tertiary level was 28 per cent. Adult
literacy was 93 per cent in 2009.1067

Attacks on schools
During 2009-2012, there was evidence of three direct
attacks on school buildings plus additional threats
against schools.
In early December 2010, for example, gunmen set fire
to a kindergarten in Ciudad Juárez on the northern
border because teachers refused to pay extortion
fees,1068 and in September 2011, threats of grenade
attacks on schools in Santiago, in the north-eastern
state of Nuevo León, caused panic among parents.1069
Additionally, in July 2012, a kindergarten and a
primary school were destroyed in Turicato, Michoacán
state, by a Catholic sect called the Followers of the
Virgin of the Rosary. Members used sledgehammers
and pick-axes to destroy six classrooms, six
bathrooms, furniture and computers and then burned
down the buildings after a leader claimed she had
received an order from the Virgin Mary to destroy
them. The sect, whose rules prohibit formal schooling,
refused to accept the secular government curriculum,
especially on science and sexuality, or government
uniforms, preferring robes and a headscarf.1070
In 2009 and 2010, there were numerous gun battles in
the vicinity of schools, in some cases resulting in the
deaths of students, teachers or parents. In Reynosa, in
2009, 20 teachers reportedly struggled to keep up to a
thousand students lying on the floor with their heads
down while, for over two hours, grenades exploded
and classroom walls were peppered with bullets
around them.1071 On 30 August 2010, a shootout
between gunmen and marines in Tampico, Tamaulipas
state, as students were leaving school, left two
children dead and two adults wounded.1072

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
At least 14 school students,1073 12 school teachers1074
and two education officials1075 were killed in attacks on
education in 2009-2012. One teacher who was a
leading teacher trade unionist was abducted and his
whereabouts remain unknown.1076 Several school
students were also abducted.1077
The threat of violence related to criminal groups
Armed criminal groups in many cases demanded that
teachers pay them a proportion of their salary or face

kidnapping or other violence. But there were also
killings of students and teachers by gunmen whose
affiliation and motive were unexplained.
In Ciudad Juárez, in November 2010, there were both
threats against individual teachers and threats posted
on school walls warning that students would be
kidnapped if teachers failed to hand over money to the
perpetrators.1078 One vice-principal of a primary school
said criminals ‘wrote graffiti on the school’s walls
saying: “If you don’t pay up a massacre will
happen”.’1079 In December 2010, the Chihuahua state
senate called on the Governor and President to adopt
a security plan to protect educational institutions in
Ciudad Juárez from extortion.1080
On 30 August 2011, at least 80 primary schools in
Acapulco, in the south-western state of Guerrero,
closed when up to 400 teachers went on strike in
protest against threats of extortion and kidnapping.1081
One week later, it was reported that this figure had
increased to 300 schools, affecting 30,000 students
in the area.1082 The trigger for the strike was reportedly
a blanket demand issued to primary schools ordering
teachers to give up 50 per cent of their pay before 1
October and part of their Christmas bonus, or face the
consequences. The threat was reportedly made by
phone, leaflets dropped off at schools and banners
posted outside them.1083 One teacher, who was a
paymaster for teachers, received a letter requesting
details of all teaching staff working in a specific area of
the Acapulco education system who earned more than
8,000 pesos bi-weekly, and all of those earning more
than 20,000 pesos. The letter also demanded the
teachers’ names, addresses and cell phone numbers,
their voter registration cards and the names and
addresses of their schools, plus the names of anyone
who declined to divulge information.1084 According to
the online newspaper Examiner.com, the threat was
confirmed by an official in Guerrero’s Department of
Education for the region of Acapulco-Coyuca de
Benítez, and it was believed that a violent criminal
group known as La Barredora had sent the
message.1085
Acapulco officials argued that teachers were overreacting.1086 However, the payroll officer at La Patria es
Primero primary school, Acapulco, who was told to

161

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

hand over information about teachers’ salaries, fled
the city.1087 Teachers demanded that military
personnel be stationed outside schools.1088
The threats were made amid a climate of pervasive
violence. Three weeks earlier, gunmen reportedly
broke into a school and snatched a student whose
body was later found in La Sabana.1089 At the start of
term, teachers in at least 75 Acapulco schools received
threats, according to a CNN report.1090 In September
2011, police found a sack of five decomposed men’s
heads dumped outside a primary school in Acapulco
along with threatening messages.1091 Also in
September, it was reported that in a three-month
period 43 teachers had been ‘express kidnapped’,
meaning they were held for a limited period but
released after a payment was made.1092
In Acapulco, 12 schools reportedly did not reopen after
the Christmas break due to the continuing demand
that teachers hand over half their salaries and all of
their bonuses.On 2 January 2012, the body of one
murdered Acapulco teacher, Maria Viruel Andraca, 51,
was left in the boot of a taxi on the Acapulco-Mexico
highway with a note reportedly left by a criminal
group,1093 sparking new protests by teachers on the
need for security measures to be implemented.1094
Elsewhere, gunmen attacked parents waiting for their
children outside a Ciudad Juárez elementary school on
25 August 2011, wounding one man and four
women.1095
Police officers assigned to protect schools and
students were also killed. On 24 February 2010, a
police officer, PC Marco Antonio Olague, was shot
dead in front of dozens of pupils as they were going
into a primary school in Chihuahua city, although the
reason was unclear.1096 Separately, on 12 September
2010, three police officers deployed to provide
security at schools and campuses were shot dead
while parked at a primary school in Ciudad Juárez
while waiting for a colleague who had gone inside.
Gunmen using AK-47 rifles sprayed the patrol vehicle
with bullets. When crime investigators arrived, the
gunmen reportedly returned and opened fire again.1097
Two teachers who were trade union members were
killed and one teacher who was a leading teacher
trade unionist was abducted, and his whereabouts

162

remain unknown. These incidents appeared to be
linked to intra-trade union rivalries over the control of
education in Oaxaca state as part of the wider struggle
between those for and against more autonomy for the
indigenous population.1098

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education included kidnappings
and murder of students and academics by gunmen;
bombings aimed at nanotechnology researchers and
facilities; and violence by police or security forces
against students.
Killings and kidnappings of students and staff
A compilation of media reports suggests that seven
academics or university personnel were murdered,1099
four were injured1100 and six were threatened;1101 in
addition, at least 15 higher education students were
killed,1102 one was tortured and four were injured.1103
Some kidnappings ended in the victims being
killed.1104 In some cases, it could not be verified
whether the crime was linked to the victim’s education
role or place of education. According to the Justice in
Mexico Project, the level of violence reportedly caused
some professors at the National Autonomous
University of Mexico, where three professors were
killed in a year, to leave their positions.1105
At least seven higher education students were
kidnapped.1106 In one incident on 5 March 2012, three
technical school students and one high school
student, aged between 13 and 21, were abducted from
their schools by heavily armed men and killed in
Cuernavaca, Morelos, in central Mexico. Their
dismembered bodies were found in plastic bags
together with a message from a drug cartel.1107
Anti-nanotechnology bombings
In 2011, according to a compilation of media reports,
six university campuses or research institutes were
targeted with bombings and one researcher was
separately assassinated in violence allegedly directed
at staff involved in nanotechnology research.1108 A
group called ‘Individuals Tending towards the Wild’
(ITS or ‘Individuales tendiendo a lo salvaje’ in
Spanish) reportedly claimed responsibility for seven
bombings and the assassination.1109

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

For instance, on 8 August 2011, two professors at the
Monterrey Institute of Technology were wounded
when a package containing a tube of dynamite in a 20
centimetre-long pipe exploded. ITS, which was also
linked to attacks against nanotechnology in France
and Spain, claimed responsibility.1110 The group was
reportedly motivated by a fear that development of
nanotechnology could lead to nanoparticles reproducing uncontrollably and threatening life on Earth.1111
According to Nature magazine, ITS also claimed
responsibility for two bomb attacks against the head
of engineering and nanotechnology at the Polytechnic
University of the Valley of Mexico in Tultitlán in April
and May 2011, the first of which wounded a security
guard.In May 2011, ITS issued a general threat to
professors and students warning them about any
suspicious packages on campus: ‘because one of
these days we are going to make them pay for everything they want to do to the earth’.1112

Attacks on education in 2013
At least six teachers were killed in 2013 for reasons
that were never established. 1118 For example, on 10
September in Acapulco, it was reported that teacher
José Omar Ramírez Castro had been shot and killed
less than 10 metres from his school as he went to give
his class, sparking a strike by 144 teachers over
insecurity and disrupting the education of over 10,000
students.1119 Threats of kidnap and extortion against
teachers also continued, with, for example, one
school in the state of Morelos responding by moving
teachers from one school to another to reduce the
possible targeting of specific teachers.1120 Police were
alleged to have used excessive force and illegally
detained protesters when they used electric batons to
disperse 300 teachers and students demonstrating
against education reforms in Veracruz in
September.1121 In higher education, attacks against
nanotechnology researchers persisted.1122

After the Monterrey bombing, the group reportedly
listed five more researchers it was targeting at the
Institute and six other universities.1113 The group also
claimed responsibility for the killing of Ernesto
Mendéz Salinas, a researcher at the Biotechnology
Institute of the National Autonomous University of
Mexico (UNAM) in November 2011.1114

Schools were attacked by state armed forces in ethnic
conflicts, and students and teachers were targeted
during an upsurge of sectarian violence between
Buddhists and Muslims in 2013.1123

Human rights violations by police and security forces

Context

One university student was wounded when police
fired warning shots at a student demonstration
against violence and the militarization of responses to
violence, in front of the Ciudad Juárez Autonomous
University Institute for Biomedical Sciences on 29
October 2010.1115

Since 1948 when British colonial rule ended, armed
ethnic groups have sought greater autonomy. The
democratic elections in 2010 led to ceasefires with
several groups in 2011-2012 and with the Kachin
Independence Organization (KIO) in 2013.1124 However,
threats to education persisted as ethnic and religious
violence between Buddhists and Muslims, the
descendants of Indian Muslims who arrived under
British rule, has continued to erupt periodically.1125

In another incident, on 12 December 2011, police fired
live ammunition while dispersing around 300 or more
student teachers blocking the motorway outside
Chilpancingo. They were demanding better resources
for rural education. The police killed two protesters
and injured three others. One of the protesters was
detained and tortured.1116
On 19 March 2010, military personnel killed two
students as they left the campus at Monterrey Institute
for Technology, planted firearms on their bodies and
falsely claimed they were ‘hit men’.1117

MYANMAR

Gross primary enrolment was 126 per cent1126 and net
secondary enrolment was 51 per cent (2010).1127 Gross
tertiary enrolment was 14 per cent and adult literacy
was estimated at 93 per cent (2011).1128

Attacks on schools
Schools have been damaged during fighting in
eastern and northern Myanmar. In Kayin state, prior to
the January 2012 ceasefire with the Karen National

163

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

Liberation Army, the Myanmar army destroyed schools
as well as other properties when they shelled entire
villages. For instance, in early February 2010, 200
soldiers attacked K’Dee Mu Der village and destroyed
15 Karen homes, a middle school and a nursery
school;1129 in the same month, a high school and
nursery school in Thi Baw Tha Kwee Lah village tract
were destroyed by Myanmar light infantry
battalions;1130 and on 23 July 2010, government forces
shelled and then set alight 50 Karen homes, a school
and a church in Tha Dah Der, a predominantly
Christian village in northern Kayin state.1131 In Kachin
state, several schools were hit by artillery, although
the intention was unclear. In August 2011, it was
reported that Myanmar military forces had laid mines
close to a school in Myitkyina township to prevent the
Kachin Independence Army (KIA) from using it.1132

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Children have also been killed and injured in attacks.
On 19 February 2010, Myanmar army soldiers in
northern Kayin state allegedly killed a 15-year-old
student and injured two others when they fired a
mortar into a camp for internally displaced persons,
hitting a school during examinations. The Karen
Human Rights Group claimed the attack was deliberate.1133
In Kachin state, between June 2011 and January 2013,
at least two schools were targeted. Five children and
one teacher were seriously injured when the Myanmar
army fired on their school in Mansi township in August
2011.1134 On 13 November 2011, 11 young students were
killed and 27 injured in a drive-by motorcycle bomb
attack on a boarding school in the state capital,
Myitkyina.1135

Military use of schools
Myanmar soldiers have occupied educational
premises and forced teachers and students to work for
them, according to the Watchlist on Children and
Armed Conflict.1136 In May 2011, for example, the army
reportedly used village schools as barracks for two
weeks, causing some students not to return.1137

164

Attacks on higher education
On 21 May 2010, a prominent imprisoned Burmese
student, Kyaw Ko Ko, was sentenced to an additional
five years for ‘illegal association and subversion’
because of a speech he had given to students in front
of Rangoon City Hall in 2007. Kyaw Ko Ko, who has
since been released and is acting as chairperson of
the All Burma Federation of Student Unions,1138 was
originally arrested for ‘possessing politically sensitive
videos’ and ‘trying to reorganize the students’
union’.1139

Attacks on education in 2013
Education in Myanmar faced a new and violent threat
from Buddhist nationalists in central and eastern
regions in 2013, as schools and students were
attacked in outbursts of sectarian violence. On 17
February, it was reported that around 300 Buddhists
had attacked an Islamic religious school in Thar-Kay-Ta
township, Rangoon,1140 and later another Muslim
school was burned down in Lashio.1141 During 20 to 21
March, while armed security forces allegedly stood by,
a mob of more than 200 Buddhists torched an Islamic
school in Meiktila and killed 32 Muslim students and
four teachers; many of them were clubbed, drenched
in petrol and burned alive, and one was decapitated,
after trying to evade the attackers by hiding in bushes
nearby. Seven Buddhists were later jailed in
connection with the school massacre.1142
One month later, in July, it was reported that 15
students had been refused permission to attend
university in person because they had been absent
through imprisonment for fighting for democracy. They
were allowed only to resume their studies via
distance-learning courses.1143

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

NIGeRIA
Many schools were bombed, set on fire or attacked by
militants in the north – and increasingly militants
turned their attention to students and teachers. Dozens
of school teachers were murdered, and at universities
there were very heavy casualties in attacks by gunmen
firing indiscriminately and in some cases also using
bombs.1144

Context
After Nigeria’s return to civilian rule in 1999, it suffered
ongoing inter-communal, political and sectarian
violence which had claimed the lives of more than
15,700 people by 2011.1145 The unrest, which continued
into 2013, was seen by observers as being underpinned by endemic corruption, poverty, poor
governance, unchecked violence by the security
services and discrimination against ethnic
minorities.1146
Misuse of public funds was seen as having a devastating impact on education quality and on attempts to
widen access to education.1147 Considerable disparities in access and quality existed among Nigeria’s
states, with education levels generally lower in the
north.1148 There remained an enduring distrust of
Western education dating back to British colonial rule
when missionary schools were largely kept out of the
north and the few that did operate there were seen as
vehicles for converting young Muslims to
Christianity.1149
From 2009 onwards, violence spiralled across
northern and central Nigeria.1150 Boko Haram, a
militant Islamist group whose commonly used name
means ‘western education is a sin’ in Hausa,1151 sought
to impose a strict form of Sharia, or Islamic law, in the
north and end government corruption. It launched
hundreds of attacks against police officers, Christians
and Muslims whom it perceived as opponents.1152
Attacks on education between 2009 and early 2011
most often involved kidnappings of students or staff
for ransom in the oil-producing Niger Delta region,
apart from a spate of attacks on schools during an
uprising by Boko Haram in July 2009.1153 However, in
2011 and 2012, the targeting of education, particularly
schools and universities, escalated, with increasing

reports of killings by Boko Haram,and reprisals
against Islamic schools and suspected Boko Haram
supporters. Schools, universities, students and
personnel also came under attack during fighting
between Christians and Muslims.
Net enrolment in primary school was 58 per cent
(2010),1154 gross secondary enrolment was 44 per cent
(2010)1155 and gross tertiary enrolment was 10 per cent
(2005).1156 The adult literacy rate was 61 per cent
(2010).1157

Attacks on schools
During an offensive by Boko Haram militants in July
2009 in Maiduguri, Borno state, a number of schools
were targeted, although the reported number varies
greatly. According to the Sunday Trust newspaper,
which provided the only detailed report, 57 schools
were destroyed and that number was confirmed by the
chairman of the state Universal Basic Education
Board. Some of the schools were named: Lamisula
School was destroyed, and at Damgari Yerwa Primary
School, two blocks of six classrooms were burned
down. Classroom blocks at Abbaganaram Primary
School, Low Cost Primary School and Goni Damgari
Primary School were also targeted.1158 The same
newspaper reported that, a year later, only a few of the
schools had been rehabilitated and none fully, and
students were studying in temporary sheds. However,
most media sources reported only one school
destroyed in July 2009, the Goodness Mercy primary
school, also in Maiduguri, which was reduced to
rubble.1159
No attacks were reported in 2010 and only isolated
attacks were reported in 2011. In Jos, in July 2011, a
rocket was fired at a co-educational Muslim-owned
school during student examinations, though responsibility for the attack was unconfirmed. The city has a
long history of violence between Christian and Muslim
communities.1160
On 27 December 2011, in an apparent reprisal attack
following a series of church bombings by Boko Haram,
a homemade bomb was thrown into the window of an
Arabic school in Delta state while a class was in
session, wounding seven people – six of them
children under the age of nine.1161

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

Then, in January 2012, Boko Haram leader Abubakar
Shekau was reported to have issued a chilling threat
via an internet audio message stating: ‘You have
primary schools as well, you have secondary schools
and universities and we will start bombing them….
That is what we will do.’ This caused fear among
parents, many of whom were reported to have stopped
sending their children to school.1162 From January to
March 2012, Boko Haram claimed responsibility for
the damage and destruction of 12 schools in and
around Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, citing
retribution for state security force attacks on a
Tsangaya (Koranic) school and the arrest of Koranic
students in January 2012.1163 At least 5,000 children
were unable to attend classes as a result,1164 in a state
with one of the country’s lowest primary school attendance rates.1165 The methods of attack varied and
included burning buildings and using explosives. All
of the attacks occurred at night or in the early morning
when schools were vacant, and in several cases,
watchmen were tied up or held at gunpoint to prevent
their intervention. The schools targeted were either
non-denominational or provided both Western and
Islamic education.1166
In May 2012, suspected Boko Haram militants used
explosives and gunfire to attack two primary schools
in the northern city of Kano.1167 From September to
November 2012, according to media sources, at least
a dozen more primary and secondary schools in
Maiduguri, Damaturu, Zaria, Barkin Ladi, Potiskum
and Fika were set on fire or damaged by explosives,
including in attacks by Boko Haram, but also during
fighting between Boko Haram and state security
forces, or in clashes between Muslims and
Christians.1168

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Prior to 2011, and in contrast with attacks on schools,
most attacks on school students, teachers and
personnel involved kidnapping for ransom and
appeared to be carried out for criminal rather than
political objectives. For example, in Abia state, in the
south-east, a school bus carrying 15 nursery and
primary school students to the Abayi International
School was hijacked in September 2010.1169 Similarly,

166

a head teacher at a primary school funded by
ExxonMobil in Eket, also in the south-east, was
abducted in October 2010.1170
Some shootings also occurred in the north, including
at a military-run secondary school near Kano in
December 2011, which left four air force personnel
dead and two injured, but the perpetrators and
motives were unknown.1171 Similarly, another shooting
resulted in the death of the head teacher of the
Government Day Secondary School in Potiskum, Yobe
state, in October 2012. According to a witness, when
he discovered the head teacher’s occupation, one of
the gunmen said: ‘You are the type of people we are
looking for.’1172
Later, in 2013, militants began targeting students and
teachers (see Attacks on education in 2013 below).
In addition, one incident appeared to be linked to
Boko Haram: the killing of Sheik Bashir Mustapha, a
prominent Muslim cleric critical of Boko Haram, and
one of his students, while he was teaching in his home
in October 2010.1173

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education facilities
Boko Haram was believed to be responsible for a
series of threats to, and bombings of, universities in
2011-2012. In July 2011, during a spate of Boko Haram
attacks in Maiduguri, officials shut the campus of
Maiduguri University after receiving an anonymous
letter warning that the student senate and examinations and records buildings would be burned down.1174
Hours later, two lecturers were reportedly killed during
clashes that took place between Boko Haram and
military forces near the campus.1175 In September 2011,
at least 15 universities reportedly received an email
message from Boko Haram, warning them that their
campuses were on a target list for bombings.1176 Boko
Haram also claimed responsibility for bomb attacks on
universities in Kano and Gombe in late April 2012.1177
The attack in Kano took place at Bayero University,
where around 20 people were killed by explosives and
gunfire while worshipping at two Christian church
services on campus, one held indoors and the other
outdoors; at Gombe University, a building was
bombed but no one was injured.1178

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Attacks on higher education students, teachers and
personnel
At least 25 people, most of them students,1179 were
killed when unknown gunmen burst into a university
residence in the north-eastern town of Mubi, in
Adamawa state, on the night of 1 October 2012, and
shot victims or slit their throats.1180 Earlier, a demand
to evacuate the university, widely believed to have
been written by Boko Haram, had been posted on a
women’s student hostel.1181
In addition to students, university staff members were
also targeted for attack, mainly in the south. Seven
university staff members were kidnapped from the
Federal College of Education, Rivers state, between
January and October 2012, and one of them died,
allegedly from torture.1182 Between 2010 and 2012, six
other higher education personnel were abducted in
the south, including two professors at the University of
Uyo; the Director of Continuing Education at the
College of Education in Afaha Nisit, Akwa Ibom; the
Provost of the College of Health Sciences at the
Nnamdi Azikiwe University; the Vice-Chancellor of
Enugu State University of Technology; and the Delta
State Commissioner for Higher Education.1183 In the
north, one lecturer from the University of Maiduguri
was also shot and killed, reportedly by Boko Haram.1184
Violence also occurred due to sectarian clashes.
During post-election violence in April 2011, on the
outskirts of Zaria in northern Kaduna state, a mob of
youths supporting former military leader Mohammadu
Buhari, who backed the imposition of sharia law in the
north, cornered four Christian students and a Christian
lecturer in the staff quarters of the campus of Nuhu
Bamalli Polytechnic and beat them to death with
sticks, clubs and machetes.1185

Attacks on education in 2013
Schools, universities, students and teachers were
attacked in northern Nigeria. A majority of these
incidents were suspected to be the work of Boko
Haram, which claimed responsibility in several
cases.1186 According to Amnesty International, more
than 50 schools were attacked and partially destroyed
or burned down in the first seven months of 2013,
most of them in Borno state and a few in neighbouring

Yobe state.1187 In the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, an
official reported to Amnesty that at least five
government secondary schools and nine private
schools were burned down between January and
April.1188 According to one Borno State Ministry of
Education official, some 15,000 children in the state
stopped attending classes between February and May
as a result of attacks.1189
While most previous attacks on schools had targeted
infrastructure and were carried out at night when
schools were empty, there appeared to be a marked
change in tactics with reports of teachers and school
students increasingly targeted.1190 In March, at least
three teachers were killed and three students
seriously injured in a simultaneous attack on four
schools in Maiduguri.1191 In June, two secondary
schools were targeted in Yobe and Borno states: seven
students and two teachers were killed when
suspected Boko Haram militants attacked their school
in Damaturu;1192 and the following day, gunmen
attacked a school in Maiduguri while students were
sitting their examinations, killing nine students.1193
In one incident in July, gunmen attacked a government
secondary boarding school in Mamudo, Yobe state, at
night, while students were sleeping. Sections of the
school and dormitory were set ablaze, and a number
of students were shot as they tried to escape. At least
22 students and one teacher were killed.1194
School teachers appeared to be targeted specifically,
with some 30 reported to have been shot dead,
sometimes during class, from January to
September.1195 A number of teachers also said they
had been intimidated by Boko Haram elements or
subjected to close surveillance by the group in remote
towns in Borno state.1196 In a video statement made in
July 2013, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau
threatened teachers, saying: ‘School teachers who are
teaching Western education? We will kill them! We will
kill them!’; he also endorsed recent school attacks
and claimed that non-Islamic schools should be
burned down.1197
One major attack also occurred on a college in Yobe
state in September. Unknown gunmen suspected to
be affiliated with Boko Haram entered the campus of
the Yobe State College of Agriculture in the middle of

167

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

the night and began firing on students in their dormitories as they slept. While casualty figures varied,
reports suggested that as many as 50 students were
killed.1198 The gunmen also reportedly set fire to classrooms. Some 1,000 students were said to have left the
campus in the wake of the attack.1199
Several other incidents involving higher education
were reported. Students alleged that the police used
tear gas and fired live ammunition to break up a
protest against university transport prices at the
University of Uyo in June, killing a student; police,
however, denied this claim, saying that the students
had brought the body to them outside the campus,
which they were prohibited from entering. University
equipment was reportedly destroyed in anger after the
killing and 45 students were arrested, of whom 44
were charged with arson and murder.1200
In another incident, on 13 February, local police
detained between 10 and 12 lecturers at Rivers State
University of Science and Technology for holding a
meeting of the local chapter of the Academic Staff
Union of Universities on campus. They were held for
five hours before being released.1201

PAKISTAN
There were a reported 838 or more attacks on schools
in Pakistan during 2009-2012, more than in any other
country, leaving hundreds of schools destroyed.
Militants recruited children from schools and
madrassas, some to be suicide bombers. There were
also targeted killings of teachers and academics.

Context
The extremely high number of schools attacked in
Pakistan during 2009-2012 was the result of multiple
sources of tension but, in particular, the Pakistani
Taliban insurgency in the north-west.
In addition to the unresolved conflict with India over
Kashmir, a series of conflicts, internal disturbances
and sectarian tensions plagued Pakistan in the run-up
to and during the reporting period. Sunni and Shi’a
Muslims periodically launched attacks against one
another, frequently causing high numbers of
casualties. In Balochistan, armed nationalist groups
not only fought the federal government but also killed
non-Balochs. The Pakistani military fought repeated
offensives against Taliban militant strongholds in the
tribal areas bordering Afghanistan throughout the
period from 2009 to 2012.1202 They also regained
control of the Swat Valley and surrounding districts
from the Pakistani Taliban. Moreover, militants carried
out attacks well beyond their strongholds, infiltrating
all major cities. The southern port city of Karachi was
periodically brought to a standstill by political and
sectarian shootings and bomb attacks as well as
violence by armed criminal gangs.1203
In the two years preceding the reporting period,
several hundred schools were damaged or destroyed,
mostly burned down by militants, as they sought to
gain control of areas of the north-west, including in
Waziristan and Swat. When the Pakistani Taliban did
gain control of the Swat Valley, they first banned girls’
education and banned women from teaching, through
an edict in December 2008, and later amended their
edict to permit the education of girls, but only up to
grade 4.1204
Many children are unable to access education for
reasons that range from cost to community attitudes
towards education, attacks on school structures or the

168

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

long distance to the nearest school. Many who enrol
may not complete a full course of study and, for those
who do, other problems, such as teacher absenteeism
and poor facilities, impinge adversely on the quality of
their education. The nature of the curriculum and the
parallel existence of private, public, and madrassa
school systems are seen by some as contributing to
social divisions.1205 Boys from urban areas attend
school for 10 years if they come from the country’s
richest 20 per cent; poor rural girls, on the other hand,
receive an average of just one year of education.1206

Whether the intention was to target school buildings
as symbols of government authority, because of their
use as army bases or because of the education
imparted in them, or for all of these reasons, is not
documented. However, the Pakistani Taliban’s record
in Swat demonstrated that preventing girls’ education
was one of their objectives.

In primary education, net enrolment was 72 per cent;
in secondary education, it was 35 per cent and gross
enrolment in tertiary education was 8 per cent (2011).
Adult literacy was 55 per cent (2009).1207

Human rights and media reports suggest that at least
30 children were killed1215 in attacks on schools and
school transport from 2009 to 2012 and more than 97
were injured.1216 At least 138 school students and staff
were reported to have been kidnapped, of whom 122
were abducted in a single incident when armed
Taliban militants seized control of a convoy of 28
school buses transporting secondary school students
and teachers in North Waziristan, bordering
Afghanistan, and tried to take them to South
Waziristan. However, 71 of the students and nine
teachers were freed in a military operation.1217 Fortytwo students and teachers remained in custody.
Initially, the militants tried to kidnap 300 students and
30 teachers but more than half were able to escape.
The Taliban reportedly used kidnapping to fund their
operations and buy weapons.1218

Attacks on schools
In areas affected by Taliban militancy, hundreds of
schools were blown up and proponents of female
education were killed. The total number of reported
militant attacks on schools in 2009-2012 was at least
838 and could be as high as 919. Difficulties faced by
journalists and other observers working in the worst
affected areas mean that the true total could be
considerably higher.1208 The Human Rights
Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) reported 505 schools
damaged or destroyed in 2009 alone.1209
There was a strong trend for schools to be blown up at
night in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (KP) province and the
Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in the
north-west.1210 Typically, perpetrators set off small,
improvised devices remotely or with timers, rarely
causing casualties. The schools were mostly
government-run but private schools catering to higher
socio-economic groups were also affected. Madrassas
were not targeted. Pakistani Taliban groups
sometimes claimed responsibility for the attacks.1211
Daytime attacks on schools included bombings and
grenade and gun attacks; one school was shelled with
mortars two years in a row.1212
The bombing of schools was an alarmingly efficient
campaign for which few of the perpetrators have been
held to account despite hundreds of schools being
destroyed.1213 Hundreds of thousands of children were
deprived of education as a result.1214

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Attacks on school students

At the start of 2009, Taliban militants were in control of
the Swat Valley in the North West Frontier province
(later renamed Khyber Pukhtunkhwa), enforcing their
hard-line interpretation of Sharia law and conducting
a violent campaign against female education. In
January 2009, they banned girls’ schooling outright,
forcing 900 schools to close or stop enrolment for
female pupils.1219 Some 120,000 girls and 8,000
female teachers stopped attending school in Swat
district.1220 Over the following months, the Pakistani
military regained control of the area but many schoolgirls and female teachers were too scared to return to
school nearly a year after the military ousted the
Taliban.1221
On 9 October 2012, Malala Yousafzai was shot, along
with two other students, Shazia Ramzan and Kainat
Riaz, on their school bus by a gunman who escaped

169

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

from the scene. The gunman asked for Malala by name
before shooting her in the face and neck and then
turning his gun on the two girls on either side of her.1222
Malala required life-saving surgery. The Tehreek-eTaliban Pakistan (TTP) spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan,
claimed responsibility, saying that the 15-year-old was
attacked for promoting values he said were secular
and anti-Taliban. Malala had written an anonymous
blog for the BBC about life as a schoolgirl under the
Taliban. She then campaigned publicly for girls’
education after the military ousted the TTP from the
Swat Valley.1223 Malala survived and went on to
campaign internationally on the same issue, and was
invited to address youth representatives at the UN
General Assembly in New York in July 2013.1224
Across Pakistan, there were at least five school bus
attacks.1225 In one attack in September 2011, Taliban
militants fired a rocket at a school bus transporting
students home from Khyber Model School near
Peshawar. When the rocket missed they opened fire
with guns on one side of the vehicle. A pupil aged 15
said he managed to help some younger pupils off the
bus under gunfire, only to encounter another volley of
bullets opening up from the second side. He was one
of 12 injured children. Four students and the driver
died.1226 Most of the other bus attacks were bombings,
including one on a bus carrying disabled schoolchildren in Peshawar in May 2009, injuring seven
students.1227
Attacks on school teachers and other education
personnel
A compilation of media and human rights reports
suggests that at least 15 school teachers were killed in
2009-20121228 and at least eight were injured,1229 of
whom four were female victims of acid attacks.1230 At
least four other education personnel, comprising one
provincial education minister, two school bus drivers
and a security guard, were killed1231 and two more were
injured. Many of the attacks, particularly against
women, appeared to be motivated by the militant
stance against female education and against women
working outside the home.1232 But in most cases, the
motive was not confirmed.
Other attacks took place in the context of civil conflict
in Balochistan. Human Rights Watch and the Human

170

Rights Commission of Pakistan documented a
campaign of targeted killings of teachers and other
education personnel considered to be ethnically nonBaloch, or who appeared to support the federal
government, for example, by flying a Pakistani flag at
school, teaching Pakistani history or asking children
to sing the national anthem.1233 The Baloch Liberation
Army (BLA) and the Baloch Liberation United Front
(BLUF) most commonly claimed responsibility for the
attacks. Most of these teachers were from Punjab
province. According to Human Rights Watch, teachers,
especially ethnic Punjabis, are seen as symbols of the
Pakistani state and of perceived military oppression in
Balochistan. The human rights organization reported
that at least 22 teachers and other education
personnel were killed in targeted attacks in
Balochistan between January 2008 and October
2010,1234 including Shafiq Ahmed, the provincial
minister for education, who was assassinated by the
BLUF in October 2009 outside his home.1235 In one
incident, Anwar Baig, a teacher at the Model High
School, Kalat, was shot nine times en route to school
by gunmen on motorbikes. The BLA claimed responsibility for his death.1236 On 24 July 2012, Abrar Ahmed,
the deputy director of schools in Balochistan, was
severely injured but survived an attack on his car in
Quetta.1237
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International
documented allegations of Pakistani intelligence and
security forces arbitrarily detaining or enforcing the
disappearance of students and teachers it suspected
of involvement in armed Baloch nationalist activities,
including the Baloch Student Organisation (Azad).1238
Fear among those who fit the armed nationalist
groups’ target profile led to lower teacher recruitment,
more transfer requests and lower attendance.1239 In
addition, Human Rights Watch cited a senior
government official who estimated that government
schools in Balochistan were only open for 120 working
days in 2009 compared to an average of 220 days for
the rest of the country.1240
Teachers opposed to the Pakistani Taliban or its
ideology or methods were also targeted, particularly in
the north-west. For example, on 22 January 2009,
Taliban militants killed a teacher at a private school in

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Matta, Swat Valley, because he had refused to follow
the dress code.1241 On 12 June 2009, the head teacher
of a religious school in Lahore was killed in his office
within the religious school complex during a suicide
bomb attack. He appeared to have been targeted for
his outspoken view that suicide bombings and other
Taliban tactics were un-Islamic.1242
Accusations of blasphemy adversely affected teachers
as well as students. A Lahore teacher was threatened
and went into hiding after omitting a section of a
religious text she was copying by hand and
erroneously juxtaposing a line about the Prophet
Mohammad and one about street beggars.1243 A 200strong mob stormed the Farooqi Girls’ High School
where she taught, accused her of blasphemy,

their school in Peshawar, Pakistan, on 19 April 2010, killing a
young boy and wounding 10 other people.

vandalized the school and set fire to the property. The
77-year-old head teacher of the school where she
taught was arrested despite not having seen the text
until after the accusations of blasphemy emerged.1244
Attacks on education aid workers
Pakistani and foreign organizations promoting
education were unable to operate freely in many areas
of the country due to the threat of militant violence,
notably in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (KP).

171

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

Six education aid workers were killed in 2009-2012.
Two teachers, one education aid worker and their
driver, working for an NGO which promotes girls’
education, were shot dead in Mansehra, KP, in April
2009.1245 Farida Afridi, director of the NGO SAWERA in
Jamrud, Khyber Agency, which provides education and
training for women, was shot dead on 4 July 2012.1246
On 8 December 2011, Zarteef Khan Afridi, the coordinator of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in
Khyber Agency, was shot dead on his way to the school
in Jamrud where he also worked as a head teacher. He
had been threatened for his anti-Taliban stance and
work for women’s rights.1247
In September 2009, the Taliban kidnapped a Greek
teacher who raised funds for a school for the nonMuslim Kalash community in the north-western Kalash
Valleys.1248

Child recruitment from schools
Militant recruitment took place from mainstream
schools as well as madrassas.1249 Public perception
most commonly associates recruitment of militants
with unregulated madrassas promoting radical
agendas. Recently, however, a clearer picture of
militant recruitment from schools has emerged.
Studies from the Brookings Institution1250 and the
International Crisis Group1251 notably blamed the lack
of quality mainstream education for children’s vulnerability to recruitment. Documentary maker Sharmeen
Obaid-Chinoy also collected first-hand accounts from
children who had been trained as suicide bombers1252
and from their militant recruiters. She described a
radicalization process that starts by isolating the child
from outside influences, including education, and
only later introduces the more extreme and violent
tenets of militant ideology in a second setting. Some
children were recruited from madrassa schools,1253
others were abducted.1254 Several children who later
escaped have described how they only realized they
were expected to become suicide bombers after they
were trapped.1255
In July 2009, the Pakistan Army claimed that up to
1,500 boys as young as 11 had been kidnapped from
schools and madrassas and trained in Swat by the
Taliban to become suicide bombers. Many were
reportedly used to attack US and NATO forces over the

172

border in Afghanistan. There was no independent
corroboration of the Army’s claims.1256 In August 2013,
The Guardian published evidence that children in
Afghanistan were being sent to madrassas in Pakistan
to be trained as suicide bombers.1257

Military use of schools
According to media reports, there were at least 40
cases of schools being used by the military,1258 five
incidents of militants based in schools1259 and one
case of the police being billeted right next to a school
in 2009-2012.1260 For example, one media report
indicated that schools in Swat district had been used
as bases by the Pakistani military for over a year,
preventing the education of around 10,000
students.1261 In another case, the Pakistani military
showed journalists a school that had been used by
militants in Sararogha as a courthouse and a base.1262
At another boarding school in Ladha, the army
claimed that it had been used to train suicide bombers
and store military hardware, including explosives,
ammunition, weapons and bomb-making chemicals,
and that texts related to combat remained. It was not
possible to verify the army’s claims.1263

Attacks on higher education
Lahore and Karachi were the worst affected cities for
regular clashes between armed political student
groups on university campuses, a spillover of the
political, ethnic and sectarian violence in these cities.
Students and teachers were also affected by Karachi’s
communal violence and a trend of kidnapping for
ransom.
Higher education staff and students were victims of
regular violence and intimidation by student political
groups on campuses, many of whom carried firearms
openly, particularly in Lahore and Karachi. In addition
to dozens of injuries, the US State Department
observed that these groups used threats of physical
violence to influence the studies and lifestyles of
students and teachers, including the course content,
examination procedures, grades, the financial and
recruitment decisions of university administrations,
the language students spoke and the clothes they
wore.1264

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Seven students were injured in the early hours of 26
June 2011 when about 25 members of the Islami Jamiat
Talba (IJT) student organization at Punjab University
attacked philosophy students with sticks, bike chains
and bricks as they slept in their halls. There were
reports of the sound of gunfire and some students
brandished pistols but did not shoot anyone. One
student was thrown from a first floor window. The IJT
had accused the philosophy department of vulgarity
and un-Islamic behaviour.1265
In addition, higher education students and staff were
attacked by those opposed to female education or
were victims of kidnappings for ransom, which often
also affected the drivers of those attacked. As with
school attacks, some simply targeted universities
because they associated them with authority. The
Taliban said that they were responsible for launching a
double suicide bombing on the International Islamic
University in Islamabad on 20 October 2009, which
killed two female and three male students, in retaliation for a Pakistani army offensive in South
Waziristan.1266
In Balochistan, there was a clear pattern of targeted
killings of academics or students of non-Baloch
ethnicity or opponents of Baloch nationalism, with
gunmen on motorbikes launching attacks in daylight
in public, usually when the victim was en route to or
from university. The BLA claimed responsibility for the
murder on 5 November 2009 of Kurshid Akhtar Ansari,
the head of library sciences at the University of
Balochistan1267 and for the murder on 27 April 2010 of
Nazima Talib, a professor at the same institution.1268
Students and academics linked with nationalist organizations disappeared in a number of cases. For
example, Amnesty International reported that a
student and member of the Baloch Students
Organisation (Azad) allegedly disappeared from his
hometown of Panjgur, Balochistan, on 21 January
2011.1269 In another incident, on 4 July 2011, a Baloch
Students Organisation (Azad) activist was abducted
from Hub town, Lasbela district, Balochistan. His
corpse was found on 6 July with three bullet wounds to
the upper body.1270
In Karachi, students were affected by outbreaks of citywide political and sectarian violence. On 26 December

2010, a bomb on the Karachi University campus
targeted praying students of the Imamia Students
Organisation, injuring five. It led to protests
demanding that the administration prevent sectarian
fighting on campus, claiming that bombs and
weapons were being brought in.1271 Shot by unidentified assailants on a motorbike while they were
talking at a tea stall outside their seminary in
November 2012, six students were among 20 people
killed during sectarian violence in one day.1272 An
academic was killed in Karachi: Maulana Muhammad
Ameen, a teacher at Jamia Binoria Alamia University
and a distinguished Sunni cleric, was gunned down by
assassins on motorbikes in October 2010.1273
Also in October 2010, Taliban assassins shot dead Dr
Mohammad Farooq Khan, in Mardan, KhyberPakhtunkhwa province. Khan was the vice-chancellor
of a new liberal university in Swat, due to be inaugurated a few days later, and had also devoted his time
to teaching 150 boys liberated from the Taliban by the
Pakistan Army at a school set up by the military in Swat
with support from international donors.1274 According
to the New York Times, he was one of six university
professors and Muslim intellectuals to have been
murdered in the previous 12 months.1275

Attacks on education in 2013
Students from kindergarten, schools and colleges,
teachers of both sexes and education institutions
across the country were attacked in Pakistan in 2013.
There were continuing attacks on schools, including
bombings,1276 grenade attacks1277 and shootings.
Female education and schooling in the north-west and
tribal areas bordering Afghanistan continued to be
targeted prominently.1278 For instance, in January,
militants shot dead five female teachers and two
health workers returning by bus from their community
project near Swabi, in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa
province.1279 In November, militants abducted 11
teachers from Hira Public School in the Khyber tribal
agency after they helped in a polio vaccination
campaign for schoolchildren.1280
There were also attacks on schools in the south-west,
in Karachi, where the Taliban has increased its
influence,1281 and in Balochistan.1282 One primary
school in western Karachi was attacked with guns,

173

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

killing the head teacher and wounding three adults
and six children attending a prize-giving ceremony in
March.1283 Another head teacher, who ran a private
school, was shot dead in Karachi in May.1284 At least
two schools designated to be used as polling stations
in 11 May elections in Balochistan were bombed.1285
In higher education, clashes continued between rival
armed student political groups1286 and there were
direct attacks on the institutions themselves,
including the detonation of one kilogramme of explosives packed with ball bearings in the conference hall
of the University of Peshawar’s Institute of Islamic and
Arabic Studies on 3 January, which injured five
students.1287 In the most serious incident, on 15 June, a
coordinated attack was launched against the Sardar
Bahaddur Khan Women’s University in Quetta and the
hospital ward where the casualties were taken. A
bomb exploded on a bus at the campus killing 14
female students and wounding 19. Ninety minutes
later, two suicide attackers and between two and 10
gunmen attacked the Bolan Medical Clinic, destroying
the casualty department and operating theatre and
killing 11, including two senior doctors and the Quetta
Deputy Police Commissioner, who had come to offer
security. Seventeen were wounded. The BBC reported
that the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi militant group, which has
carried out many attacks against Shia Muslims, was
responsible,1288 but said the attack may have been
targeting women in general rather than Shias, as the
university is the sole all-women university in
Balochistan.1289

THe PHILIPPINeS
There were killings and abductions of teachers,
bombing and shelling of schools and universities, with
some incidents related to their use as polling stations.
The armed forces continued to use numerous schools
for military purposes in breach of Philippines’ law.1290

Context
Two main conflicts in the Philippines have led to intermittent violence. In the communist insurgency, the
New People’s Army is fighting the government with the
aim of creating a socialist state; and in the Moro
conflict, concentrated in the south, militant groups,
including the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and
the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), are
fighting for self-rule. Civilians have been targeted via
bombings, kidnappings, and the forced recruitment
and use of children in fighting forces. Thousands have
been killed and hundreds of thousands more
displaced.
The Abu Sayyaf Group, which began as an Islamic
separatist group but has also become involved in
banditry and other crimes, remains active in parts of
the southern Philippines. In Mindanao, in the
southern Philippines, rival clan disputes and a proliferation of criminal activities have compounded the
pattern of violence in the region.1291
Recurrent attacks on education in Mindanao and other
parts of the country have disrupted schooling for
many, causing fear among students, teachers and
parents and inflicting damage on learning facilities.1292
The UN verified some 43 incidents countrywide
involving damage, destruction or occupation of
education facilities, placement of landmines and
unexploded ordnance near schools, and violence or
threats of violence against teachers and students from
2010 to 2012; and 92 more incidents were recorded
but could not be verified due to geographic and
human resource constraints.1293 Collectively, these 135
incidents were estimated to have affected some 8,757
students.1294
Net primary enrolment was 88 per cent,1295 net
secondary enrolment was 62 per cent1296 and gross
tertiary enrolment was 28 per cent (2009).1297 The
adult literacy rate was 95 per cent (2008).1298

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Attacks on schools
The UN reported 10 incidents of attacks on schools
and hospitals in 2009, resulting from ongoing
clashes between the military and armed groups.1299
Levels of violence appeared to increase around the
2010 elections, during which schools were used as
polling stations in May and October, with 41 schools
and hospitals attacked that year.1300 In 2011, there
were 52 incidents affecting schools and hospitals,
although this number included both direct attacks and
military use.1301 Twenty-seven cases, of which 16 were
verified by the UN, were attributed to the Armed Forces
of the Philippines and its associated auxiliary force,
Citizen Armed Force Geographical Units (CAFGU),
including one school being set on fire during an
airstrike. Six incidents were attributed to the MILF, four

station during local elections in Maguindanao province,

to the New People’s Army, three to the Abu Sayyaf
Group and another 12 to unknown perpetrators.1302
In 2012, at least 19 attacks on schools were recorded
by August.1303 For example, Abu Sayyaf Group fighters
partially burned down Tipo-Tipo Central Elementary
School in an effort to distract a military pursuit by the
national armed forces after skirmishes in Basilan
province in July 2012.1304

175

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

Some 15 landmines and unexploded ordnance were
found within the vicinity of schools from 2010 to 2012,
and six grenade attacks and three instances of mortar
shelling were also recorded.1305 At least 17 schools
were partially damaged and three schools destroyed
in the same period.1306

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
From 2010 to 2012, there was a pattern of attacking
teachers. At least 14 teachers were killed, three
injured, five threatened or harassed, six abducted and
one arbitrarily detained.1307 Three students were
abducted.1308
In a number of cases, teachers or students were
abducted, sometimes for ransom, by the Abu Sayyaf
Group.1309 For example, in October 2009, Abu Sayyaf
gunmen allegedly abducted an elementary school
head teacher from a passenger jeep transporting a
group of teachers and later beheaded him after his
family refused to pay the requested ransom.1310
In other incidents there was an observable pattern of
targeting teachers in connection with their duty as
election poll officers.1311 During 2010, some 11 teachers
were killed,1312 with a significant number of attacks
recorded at the height of the presidential election in
May 2010 – although attacks were still taking place in
and outside of school premises months later, perpetrated mostly by unidentified assailants – and during
local elections.1313 For example, a few days after the 25
October 2010 barangay (village) elections, the head
teacher of Datu Gumbay Elementary School in
Maguindanao was shot dead by unidentified gunmen;
weeks later, on 2 December 2010, a lone gunman
killed another teacher at the same school while he
was standing near the gate in sight of students and
other teachers.1314

Military use of schools
The practice of military use of schools is explicitly
banned in the Philippines, both under national legislation and military policy.1315 Despite this, at least 56
incidents of military use of schools, mostly involving
use by government armed forces, were recorded by the
UN from 2010 to 2012.1316 School buildings, particularly in remote areas, offered convenient protection

176

and were often used as temporary barracks or for other
military purposes ranging from a period of one week to
more than a year.1317
For instance, according to the UN, the Armed Forces of
the Philippines and its Citizen Armed Force
Geographical Units used functioning schools as
weapons and ammunition stores in 20101318 and, in
2011, used at least 14 schools during the course of
counterinsurgency operations.1319 Troops slept in
teacher housing and also used several classrooms at
Nagaan Elementary School in Mindanao for at least
seven months.1320 In 2012, the UN verified four
incidents involving the stationing of national armed
forces’ military units in public elementary schools in
Mindanao, as well as the establishment of a
detachment next to Salipongan Primary School in
Tugaya municipality, Lanao del Sur province, that
closed the school for two weeks.1321

Attacks on higher education
Media reports documented several attacks or
attempted attacks on university buildings and
grounds, including one related to use of the buildings
as polling stations: on an election day in 2010, two
bombs exploded at Mindanao State University where
several polling stations were based.1322
In August 2012, the main campus of Mindanao State
University was sealed off by the Armed Forces of the
Philippines after gunmen opened fire in an attack
inside the campus during which three soldiers were
killed and 10 others wounded.1323

Attacks on education in 2013
Abduction and killing of teachers were reported in
2013. Three teachers and three head teachers were
reported to have been shot dead or in one case shot
and ‘disappeared’ in separate incidents.1324 Mostly,
the attackers were unidentified and the motives were
not confirmed. In one of the incidents, on 22 January,
Sheikh Bashier Mursalum, a respected Muslim
scholar and the principal of a madrassa, was
reportedly shot and abducted by suspected state
security agents in Zamboanga City; he remained
missing at the end of August.1325 On 31 July, it was
reported that Abu Sayyaf Group rebels had released
abductee Alrashid Rojas, an employee of Western

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Mindanao State University, and head teacher
Floredeliza Ongchua, who had been forcibly taken
from her home by 13 men in June.1326
On 11 September, during a battle between Muslim
insurgents and the Philippine army in Zamboanga,
soldiers used a school as a base for an unspecified
period.1327 In September, Bangsamoro Islamic
Freedom Fighters used nine teachers as human
shields during fighting with government forces after
earlier holding 13 teachers and some students
hostage at a school.1328
In higher education, a bomb planted by unknown
militants exploded on the University of Southern
Mindanao campus, causing widespread panic among
staff and students.1329

RUSSIA
The main threat to education came in the Caucasus,
where schools were attacked and teachers and
academics were murdered.1330

Context
Teachers, academics and religious scholars in Russia
have been targeted for assassination by suspected
armed Islamist militants seeking to impose their
religious views.
Vladimir Putin has held the political reins since
December 1999, during which time the country faced
increasing attacks by Islamist insurgents in the
northern Caucasus. The militants’ objective was a
regional emirate based on Sharia law.1331
The issue of whether students should be allowed to
wear headscarves was contentious in parts of
Russia.1332 Official permission to wear a headscarf in
school was granted by the government of Dagestan, a
mainly Muslim republic, in September 2013, whereas
in the nearby Stavrapol Region, the ban had been
upheld by the Supreme Court five months earlier.1333
Russia’s net primary enrolment was 93 per cent,1334
gross secondary enrolment was 89 per cent1335 and
gross tertiary enrolment was 76 per cent (2009).1336
Adult literacy was 100 per cent (2010).1337

Attacks on schools
From 2009 to 2012, at least three schools were
attacked.1338 As noted below (in Military use of
schools), two schools were attacked as an apparent
response to their designated use by government
forces.1339 In June 2009, militants reportedly fired
grenades at a school in Grozny, Chechnya. The
reasons were not known.1340
Separately, at least four bomb and gun attacks in the
vicinity of schools were identified in the North
Caucasus.1341 In one incident, alleged terrorists
exploded several bombs near School No.1 in Kizlyar,
Dagestan, in March 2010, killing 12 people and
injuring around 30; however, no students from the
school were reported dead or injured.1342

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
During the period 2009-2012, five teachers were killed
in Dagestan, several of them by suspected Islamist
insurgents, the others by unidentified assailants,
according to news reports.1343 In one case, a physical
education teacher, opposed to extreme Islamist
beliefs, was cut down by sub-machine gunfire as he
left a mosque after praying, in Tsbari village, Tsuntin
region, in June 2012.1344 In at least two cases, head
teachers were reported to have been assassinated
because they were against the wearing of headscarves
or hijab at school.1345 In one of these incidents, a head
teacher was shot dead in July 2011 by two assassins in
front of his family in the courtyard of his home in the
village of Sovyetskoye near the Azeri border,
Dagestan.1346

Military use of schools
Two schools were set aside for use as military bases
during 2009-2012: in June 2012, suspected armed
militants burned down one school and then attacked
another in Tsyntuk village, Dagestan, apparently
because government forces had earmarked them for
use as bases for counter-insurgency security operations.1347

Attacks on higher education
Five academics and scholars were shot dead or killed
in explosions by armed Islamist militants.1348 In

177

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

December 2010, a leading Kabardino-Balkaria
scholar, Aslan Tsipinov, was killed by armed militants.
His work on Adyghe national culture was seen by
Islamic extremists as spreading paganism.1349 In
March 2012, a medical school director, Magomedrasul
Gugurchunov, was killed in Makhachkala after
receiving death threats from extremists in an attempt
to force him to pay their extortion demands.1350 Fear of
armed Islamic militants in the North Caucasus caused
academics to curtail their research.1351

Attacks on education in 2013
In 2013, teachers continued to be targeted.1352 On 4
March, it was reported that Magomed Biyarslanov, a
teacher at an Islamic school in Karabudakhkentsky in
Dagestan, died after being shot eight times in the
chest.1353 On 15 July, a teacher in the Tsumada district
of Dagestan was killed by armed attackers wearing
illegal military-style uniforms who arrived at his home,
separated him from his family, then shot him several
times at close range.1354

SOMALIA
Islamic militants recruited large numbers of children
from school and abducted girls for forced marriage to
fighters. Suicide bombings targeting students took a
very heavy toll, and schools and universities were used
as military bases for fighting.1355

Context
Since the collapse of the Siad Barre regime in 1991,
Somalia has been wracked by a civil conflict marked
by widespread abuses against civilians and with
devastating effects on education, including the
destruction and damage of schools and universities
and the closure of education facilities for long periods
of time, particularly in the south and central parts of
the country.1356 In many areas, only private schools
have been operational.1357 As of 2012, an estimated 1.8
million school-age children were out of school in the
south-central zones of Somalia.1358
School enrolment rates were among the lowest in the
world; the net attendance rate1359 was 18 per cent for
boys and 15 per cent for girls at primary school level,
and 12 per cent for boys and 8 per cent for girls at

178

secondary level (2007-2011).1360 Only 20 per cent of
the population was literate in 2012.1361
The conflict intensified in late 2006, following the
overthrow of the Islamist Court Union (ICU) by
Ethiopian armed forces. An offshoot of the ICU, an
armed Islamist group known as Al-Shabaab slowly
began to establish control over Mogadishu and other
areas of south and central Somalia.1362 Government
forces, backed at different times by Ethiopian, Kenyan
and African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)
troops,1363 along with government-affiliated militia
including the Sufi Islamist group Ahlu Sunna Wal
Jama’a (ASWJ)1364 and more recently the Ras Kamboni
clan militia,1365 have been fighting Al-Shabaab. After
mid-2011 and especially in 2012, the African Union
forces and Ethiopian troops, alongside Somali
government forces and allied militia, regained control
of a number of towns held by Al-Shabaab in southcentral Somalia. However, Al-Shabaab retains
authority over large swathes of south-central Somalia,
particularly in rural areas of the country.1366

Attacks on schools
The UN verified 79 attacks on education between
January 2011 and December 2012 alone, affecting at
least 5,677 children.1367 However, security challenges
and lack of access to large areas of south-central
Somalia made it impossible to determine the exact
number of schools, students and education staff
attacked.1368
Indiscriminate mortar fire exchanged in civilian areas,
particularly in the country’s capital Mogadishu,
endangered schools, damaging and destroying
buildings and killing or wounding students and
teachers. For example, a mortar shell that landed in a
Koranic school killed four students and wounded 10
others during fighting between Transitional Federal
Government armed forces and armed groups in
Mogadishu on 13 January 2009.1369 On 25 February
2009, two schools were damaged, six schoolchildren
killed and another 13 wounded during an exchange of
fire between the TFG/AMISOM military and insurgents,
also in Mogadishu.1370
Several students reported to Human Rights Watch that
their schools had been targeted by Al-Shabaab,

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

including during the Ramadan Offensive in Mogadishu
in August 2010. For example, one boy recounted that
his school had been ‘continually attacked’ by AlShabaab during the offensive and that, in one
incident, a neighbouring classroom had been shelled.
Another student claimed that in Baidoa, in late 2010,
Al-Shabaab militants pulled up outside his school and
shelled it.1371

curriculum.1381 In April 2010, Al-Shabaab reportedly
forbade schools in Jowhar from announcing the end of
classes with bells because they were reminiscent of
those rung in churches.1382 This violence and
harassment has caused teachers to flee, hundreds of
schools to close for varying lengths of time, and
students, particularly girls, to drop out in large
numbers.1383

Explosives placed on or near school grounds seriously
endangered students and teachers. In one case, a
bomb planted near Mahamud Harbi Secondary
School, in Wardhigley, exploded in November 2011,
killing four children.1372 In August 2012, explosives left
outside a school killed at least six children aged from 5
to 10 and injured at least four more who were playing
with them in the town of Balad.1373

In one instance, a teacher reported to Human Rights
Watch that he fled Somalia in 2011 after the head
teacher and deputy at his school were shot for refusing
to stop teaching certain subjects. At his previous
school, Al-Shabaab fighters had stabbed him in the
upper lip with a bayonet while he was teaching a
geography lesson and had abducted a female teacher
not wearing a hijab. Her body was later found near the
town mosque.1384

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
1374

In October 2011, a suicide attack by Al-Shabaab at
the Ministry of Education killed an estimated 100 or
more people,1375 many of whom were students and
parents waiting for scholarship examination results.
Another suicide bombing at Benadir University’s
graduation ceremony (see Attacks on higher
education) in Mogadishu killed the Minister of
Education in December 2009;1376 and eight students
were killed in a suicide bombing on school grounds
carried out by an 11-year-old disguised as a food seller
in October 2009.1377
In areas it controlled, Al-Shabaab imposed its interpretation of Islam on schools and threatened or killed
teachers for refusing to comply with its demands. 1378
This included prohibiting the teaching of English,
geography and history; forcing the separation of girls
and boys in schools and restricting girls’ dress;
preventing women from teaching; imposing their own
teachers in schools; and using class time to teach
extreme Islamist ideology.1379 The US State
Department reported that, in at least one instance in
2011, Al-Shabaab offered to reward academic
achievement with AK-47 rifles.1380 In September 2009,
Al-Shabaab warned against using UN-provided
textbooks, claiming they were teaching students ‘unIslamic’ subjects. They also called for parents not to
send their children to schools using a UN-supported

In a similar vein, Hizbul Islam, an armed Islamist group
which merged with Al-Shabaab in late 2010,
reportedly arrested a head teacher who had raised a
Somali flag over his school in December 2009. The
group replaced the flag with a black Islamist one.
Students took to the street in protest, drawing fire
from Hizbul Islam militants that killed at least two
students and injured another five.1385 In other
instances, teachers were targeted for refusing to enlist
students as Al-Shabaab fighters (see Child
recruitment from schools).
Some teachers, students and education officials were
also kidnapped and held for ransom during 20092012 including the education minister for the region of
Galmudug, reportedly for refusing to pay a ransom for
the release of a kidnapped student.1386
Insecurity and Al-Shabaab threats impeded humanitarian and development assistance for education,
with particular agencies, humanitarian workers,
offices and supplies targeted.1387 Al-Shabaab
proclaimed a ban on more than a dozen individual
agencies from 2009 onwards and imposed another
ban in 2011 on 16 aid organizations operating in areas
under its control, including several UN agencies.1388
On 6 January 2009, three masked gunmen shot and
killed 44-year-old Somali national Ibrahim Hussein
Duale while he was monitoring school feeding in a

179

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

World Food Programme-supported school in the Gedo
region.1389

of education facilities. Others were used as weapons
caches.1399

Military use of schools

Child recruitment from schools

Between May 2008 and March 2010, armed groups
used at least 34 schools.1390 In some cases, multiple
groups occupied the same school at different times.
For example, Waaberi primary school located in Gedo
was used by TFG forces, ASWJ, Ethiopian Defence
Forces (EDF) and Al-Shabaab in August 2009. It was
used as a defensive fort, resulting in heavy damage to
the buildings.1391

When fighting intensified in Mogadishu in mid-2010,
Al-Shabaab increasingly recruited children from
schools in order to fill its dwindling ranks. Boys and
girls were recruited from schools by force as well as by
enticing them with propaganda and material
rewards.1400 A number of children interviewed by
Human Rights Watch in May and June 2011 reported
that Al-Shabaab members had taught in their classrooms, encouraging them to join the group and
promising ‘entry into paradise’ for those who died
fighting.1401

Military use of schools continued in 2011 and 2012.
According to the UN, Al-Shabaab used a school in
Elwak district, Gedo region, in August 2011, interrupting the education of over 500 children; the school
had been used intermittently by armed groups since
February 2011.1392 In December 2011, Al-Shabaab
militia established an operations centre at a
secondary school in Merka district, Lower Shabelle
region.1393 TFG forces also reportedly used schools in
Mogadishu.1394 A UN respondent reported that in 2012
at least five schools in the Bay, Gedo and Hiraan
regions of central and southern Somalia were
occupied or used as hospitals, police stations or
prisons by Al-Shabaab, EDF, Somali National Armed
Forces (SNAF) and regional authorities, affecting some
1,933 children.1395 In late May 2012, following the
takeover of the Afgooye corridor by AMISOM and TFG
forces, the TFG and its National Security Agency (NSA)
rounded up dozens of people and used the Afgooye
Secondary School as a base and a detention centre.1396
Schools were also used as firing bases. Al-Shabaab
launched artillery attacks from school grounds,
drawing return fire from TFG and AMISOM forces. In
some cases, students and teachers were inside.1397 For
example, Human Rights Watch reported that in 2010
Al-Shabaab fighters used a school in Mogadishu as a
firing position while students were still in the classrooms. Pro-government forces returned fire, and five
rockets hit the school compound. One rocket struck
just as the students were leaving, killing eight.1398
Al-Shabaab occupied some schools after they had
been closed due to insecurity, making it impossible for
classes to resume and risking damage or destruction

180

While the exact numbers of children recruited are not
known, the UN indicated that Al-Shabaab abducted an
estimated 2,000 children for military training in
2010.1402 At least another 948 children were recruited
in 2011, mainly by Al-Shabaab and mostly from
schools and madrassas.1403 Human Rights Watch
reported that it had interviewed 23 Somali children
recruited or abducted by Al-Shabaab in 2010 and
2011; 14 had been taken from schools or while en
route, which gives some indication of the extent to
which schools were ready sites for forced recruitment
and abduction.1404 Of the 79 attacks on education
recorded by the UN from January 2011 to December
2012, 21 involved the recruitment of 244 children (21
girls and 223 boys) from schools by anti-government
elements.1405
Teachers and school managers also received orders
from Al-Shabaab and other armed groups to enlist
students or release them for training.1406 The UN
reported that in June 2010 alone, Al-Shabaab ordered
teachers and school managers in Lower Shabelle to
release more than 300 students to be trained, threatening punishment for failure to comply.1407 In October
2011, Al-Shabaab was reported to have closed two of
the biggest schools in the capital of the lower Shabelle
region after the head teachers refused to recruit
students to fight.1408 In May 2011, the UN reported the
murder of a teacher in the Hiraan region by Al-Shabaab
for having objected to child recruitment.1409 In
February 2012, five teachers were reportedly arrested

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

for failing to enlist their students in military
training.1410
Human Rights Watch research in Somalia found
evidence of girls being taken from schools and forced
to become ‘wives’ of Al-Shabaab fighters. In one case,
the girls were selected at gunpoint; one who refused
to be taken was shot in front of her classmates. In
another, after 12 girls were taken by Al-Shabaab, the
teacher reported that some 150 female students
dropped out of school.1411 He also reported that a 16year-old girl who was taken was beheaded and her
head was brought back and shown to the remaining
girls at the school as a warning because she had
refused to marry a fighter much older than she was.1412

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education facilities
Bombs and mortar fire damaged at least two universities, in one case killing university personnel. For
example, Al-Shabaab allegedly destroyed a Sufi
Muslim university in central Somalia in 2009.1413 In
March 2011, a mortar hit a Somali University building
in the Bar Ubah neighbourhood of Mogadishu, killing
a university lecturer, wounding two security guards
and destroying a section of lecture halls. It is unclear
whether the attack was intentional.1414 In October
2011, a bomb exploded at Gaheyr University, targeting
TFG/AMISOM troops based there. In November 2011, a
bomb left in the middle of the road in the vicinity of the
university also exploded.1415
Attacks on higher education students, academics and
personnel
At least one attack on higher education students and
personnel was reported. In December 2009, a male
suicide bomber disguised as a veiled woman blew
himself up during a Benadir University medical school
graduation ceremony in Mogadishu, killing 22 people
including the ministers of education, higher education
and health, the dean of the medical school,
professors, students and their relatives, and
wounding at least 60 more.1416 Though suspected, AlShabaab denied having committed the attack.1417

Military use of higher education facilities
Reports indicate that armed groups, AMISOM and
government troops also used university campuses,
particularly during the 2012 military campaigns that
drove Al-Shabaab out of several of their urban strongholds. In January 2012, after a heavy gun battle,
AMISOM troops succeeded in forcing Al-Shabaab out
of its positions in and around the buildings of
Mogadishu University, among several other key areas
in the northern outskirts of Mogadishu.1418 In
September 2012, AMISOM and Somali National Army
troops captured Kismayo University in the northern
part of Kismayo during an operation to take control of
the city and used it as a temporary military base for
nearly a month.1419 Gaheyr University was reported to
have been serving as an AMISOM base in 2011,1420
while Ethiopian troops used Hiraan University as a
military base in early 2012, forcing the university to set
up a makeshift campus inside the town of
Beletweyne.1421

Attacks on education in 2013
The number of attacks reported to the UN during the
period from January to September was lower in
comparison to the same period in 2012, most likely
due to lower general levels of conflict.1422 As of
September, a total of 42 attacks on education had
been reported compared with 63 attacks during the
same period of the previous year.1423 Almost half of
these attacks occurred in the Benadir region and many
were associated with security operations conducted
by government security forces while searching for AlShabaab elements.1424
In January, AMISOM troops were alleged to have fired
mistakenly on a religious school in a village 120
kilometres west of Mogadishu while pursuing
militants, killing five children under the age of 10.1425 In
March, two children died and three more were injured
when a student unwittingly triggered an IED at a
Koranic school in Heraale, Galgadud region.1426

Schools were destroyed, damaged and looted by
armed groups and armed forces during
inter-communal violence and border incursions during
2009-2013. Dozens of schools were used for military
purposes, some for up to five years.1427

Context
South Sudan gained independence in July 2011.1428
However, cross-border skirmishes and intercommunal violence continued to pose threats to
civilians. The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) also
launched sporadic incursions and abduction raids
during the first half of the reporting period. An
internal conflict broke out between rebels and the
government in December 2013, leading to killings
along ethnic lines.
Two decades of civil war prior to its independence
from Sudan greatly hindered the development of the
education system. Schools were occupied and
damaged or destroyed, teachers and students
displaced and children abducted or forcibly recruited
by both sides.1429
Gross enrolment was 64 per cent at primary level and
6 per cent at secondary level in 2012.1430 Protracted
conflict has left South Sudan with an adult literacy
rate of only 27 per cent.1431

Attacks on schools
Attacks on schools became less frequent after the
signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in
2005, but some school buildings were damaged or
destroyed during inter-communal violence, LRA
activity and incursions along the contested border
with Sudan during 2009-2012.
In one incident, during fighting between Sudan
People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) forces and cattlekeepers in Warrap state in March 2010, four schools
were destroyed.1432 Thirteen schools were set on fire
during inter-ethnic fighting in Jonglei state from late
2011 to early 2012.1433
From July 2009 to February 2012, the UN verified two
attacks on schools by the LRA.1434

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Before independence, there were a few isolated
attacks on students and education officials by the LRA
in Southern Sudan. For instance, in Tambura county,
Western Equatoria, in 2010, the LRA killed two state
education ministry officials,1435 and in a separate
incident abducted three children between the ages of
8 and 15 from schools during raids on villages.1436 The
LRA also abducted five children from a school in the
same county in February 2011.1437
Several student protests were met with excessive use
of force and resulted in arrest, injury and, in one case,
death. For instance, at a school in Central Equatoria
state on 28 December 2009, anti-riot police shot and
killed a 16-year-old who was taking part in a demonstration against the non-payment of teachers.1438 Two
people, including a teacher, were wounded when
police used live ammunition to break up a protest at
Juba Day Secondary School over an alleged land-grab
of school property in October 2012.1439

Military use of schools
Primary and secondary schools were used by armed
forces, often with the consent of local authorities,
either for temporary accommodation while travelling,
or as a base for operations against rebel militia or in
response to inter-communal violence. Mostly, schools
were used temporarily but some were used for up to
five years.1440 According to the Education Cluster, the
cost of rehabilitating a primary school after a period of
military use was approximately 200,000 South
Sudanese Pounds (USD 64,500).1441
Between 2011 and 2012, 34 schools were used for
military purposes, affecting 28,209 learners across
nine states.1442 For example, the SPLA was reported to
have used two schools as places to torture suspects in
2010.1443 At Kuerboani Primary School, in Unity state,
soldiers occupied the school at night while children
used the same facilities during the day. UN staff
witnessed children using classrooms where weapons
and grenades were stored.1444 By December 2012, 15 of
the 18 schools occupied that year were vacated.1445

184

Attacks on higher education
Military use and looting of Upper Nile University were
recorded during clashes between South Sudanese
government forces and a militia group in Malakal in
early 2009.1446

Attacks on education in 2013
Despite successful advocacy efforts resulting in a
number of schools being vacated, military use was
consistently documented throughout the first three
quarters of 2013.1447 Negotiations resulted in the
vacating of most schools occupied by the SPLA by the
end of 2012; however, the first quarter of 2013 saw a
rise in incidence, with the SPLA using 16 of the 18
schools occupied in Jonglei, Western Bahr el Gazal
and Lakes states by the end of March.1448 During the
month of May, two schools were newly occupied by the
SPLA in Jonglei state, though vacated shortly thereafter, and three schools were occupied and vacated by
Auxiliary Police in Eastern Equatoria state; while six
schools were vacated in Jonglei, Lakes and Western
Bahr el Gazal, seven remained occupied.1449 The
number continued to fluctuate1450 but, by the end of
September, armed forces were using at least six
schools.1451 However, on 14 August, the SPLA issued an
order prohibiting its forces from recruiting or using
children or occupying or using schools in any
manner.1452
Fighting between ethnic Murle rebels from the South
Sudan Democratic Movement/Army (SSDM/A) and the
SPLA in Pibor county, Jonglei state, resulted in the
looting and damage of schools in April and May.1453
Human Rights Watch reported the looting of at least
three schools and the destruction of classroom
materials; the majority of these actions were said to
have been carried out by the SPLA. Soldiers also
reportedly destroyed a school in the Labrab area.1454
During the capture of Boma town by SSDM/A rebels
and the subsequent recapture by the SPLA in May, part
of an NGO teacher training centre was set on fire and
all its contents taken, while a school supported by the
NGO was ransacked and destroyed.1455
At Maban refugee camp in Upper Nile state, landmines
were found behind the Darussalam School on 21
March and caused the suspension of Child Friendly
Spaces activities.1456

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

SUDAN
More than 1,000 university students were arrested,
more than 15 killed and more than 450 injured in
2009-2012, mostly in demonstrations on campus or in
education-related protests. Many of the injuries
resulted from security forces using excessive force.
There were dozens of incidents of attacks on, and
military use of, schools.1457

Context
In Sudan’s western region of Darfur, fighting between
government forces and pro-government militia and
rebels over the past decade has left 300,000 people
dead and more than two million displaced,1458 with
schools set on fire and looted and students and
teachers targeted by armed groups.1459
Sudan’s protracted civil war between the government
and southern rebels ended in 2005 with the signing of
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which paved
the way for South Sudan’s independence in July
2011.1460 However, unresolved secession issues have
led to cross-border violence, particularly in the three
disputed areas of Abyei, Blue Nile and South
Kordofan.1461
Students, teachers, schools and universities have
been targeted during decades of conflict and instability. The government exercises tight control over
higher education, appointing public university vicechancellors and determining the curriculum.1462
As of 2011, approximately 72 per cent of adults were
literate.1463 In 2009, before the secession of the South,
gross enrolment at primary level was 73 per cent1464
and 39 per cent at secondary level.1465 Tertiary gross
enrolment was 6 per cent in 2000.1466

looted, including primary and secondary schools and
a teacher training institute, in the areas of Darfur,
Abyei, Blue Nile and South Kordofan during 20092012, but again it was not specified how many were
targeted.1468
According to the UN, three instances of burning,
looting and destruction of schools occurred between
January 2009 and February 2011.1469 For example,
militia attacked a school in Tawila, North Darfur, in
September 2010, killing four children who had sought
refuge there.1470 The reported number of schools
bombed or shelled then increased between June 2011
and April 2012 as fighting intensified between the
government and the rebel Sudan People’s Liberation
Movement/Army-North (SPLM/A-N) in Blue Nile and
South Kordofan,1471 and aerial bombing of civilian
targets by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) took a
significant toll,1472 although it has not been verified
whether the schools were deliberately targeted. For
example, in August 2011, an SAF Antonov bomber
dropped four bombs on Al Masha Secondary School in
Kauda1473 and in February 2012, the SAF destroyed two
buildings of a bible school in the village of Heiban,
dropping two bombs into its compound.1474 Mortar
shelling, for which the SPLM-N claimed responsibility
and which the UN criticized as indiscriminate, also
damaged one school in Kadugli in October 2012.1475
The UN estimated that as of December 2011, 137,900
schoolchildren in South Kordofan were missing out on
education because their schools had been damaged,
destroyed or were still dangerous because explosive
remnants of past fighting remained on site, or were
being used as shelters by armed forces and IDPs.
However, it is not specified how many schools were
damaged or destroyed in targeted attacks.1476

Attacks on schools
There were different accounts of how many schools
were attacked during 2009-2012. According to Arry
Organization for Human Rights and Development, 48
schools were destroyed in attacks by government
forces in South Kordofan between April 2011 and
February 2012, but it was not specified if these were
targeted attacks.1467 Other UN, human rights and
media reports documented 12 cases of schools or
education buildings being destroyed, damaged or

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Media and human rights reports suggest that at least
29 school students, two teachers and one head
teacher were killed and another three students and a
head teacher’s assistant were wounded in attacks in
2009-2012 by rebels, soldiers or unidentified armed
men in the Darfur region, though the motives were not
known in all cases.1477

185

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

In some incidents, the perpetrators appeared to be
members of armed groups. For example, a group of
armed men killed two Fur high school students from
Tournato village on their way to pay their school fees at
Kass High School on 13 December 2009.1478 Members
of a militia allegedly killed a primary school student in
Zam Zam camp in North Darfur in December 2012,
while he was studying with six classmates who
escaped unharmed.1479 In October 2011, four armed
men reportedly shot and killed the head teacher of
Shagra Eltadamoun primary school and wounded his
assistant while they were on their way to submit the
names and fees of students sitting for the national
primary examinations.1480 In one of the most serious
incidents, but not necessarily a targeted one,
suspected pro-government militia reportedly killed 18
schoolchildren when they opened fire in a market next
to the elementary school in Tabra, North Darfur, in
September 2010.1481
In other incidents, teachers and students were killed,
injured or arrested by government authorities. On 31
July 2012, at least six secondary school students, aged
16 to 18, were killed and more than 50 other people
injured during confrontations between police and
anti-government protesters during reportedly largely
peaceful demonstrations in Nyala. According to
Human Rights Watch, the protests started at the
schools and spread into the streets with protesters
burning tyres. Schools were reported to have been
closed temporarily following the incident.1482 On 1
November 2012, the National Intelligence and Security
Services (NISS) reportedly arrested and tortured a
dozen secondary school and university students in
Nyala, South Darfur. One of them received acid burns
on his hand.1483 Relatives said the victims were given
electric shocks using water and car batteries.1484 The
students were accused of stealing money from the
NISS agents1485 but their families said the real motive
for their arrest was their presumed participation in the
Nyala protests.1486
In another incident on 19 December 2012, police used
teargas and batons to disperse teachers protesting
against low wages and alleged corruption in the
Ministry of Education.1487

Military use of schools
According to the UN, as of February 2011, three
schools were used by the SAF in South Kordofan,
including one primary school in El Buram town which
was occupied despite the fact that pupils were
attending classes nearby.1488 Military use of schools in
El Buram by the SAF continued throughout 2011.1489

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education students, academics and
personnel
A compilation of human rights and media reports
suggests that 15 or more university students were
killed1490 and at least 479 were injured,1491 many when
police and security forces used excessive force against
students demonstrating on campus over university
policies,1492 including limits on political and cultural
activity on campus and the charging of tuition fees for
Darfuri students from which they were supposed to be
exempted by government agreement.1493
These incidents took place across the country
including in Gedaref, Kassala, Khartoum, Nyala, Port
Sudan and River Nile state. Furthermore, according to
figures compiled for this study from over 50 human
rights and media reports, at least 1,040 students1494
were arrested by security agents, the majority of them
in protests related to education or which began at, or
took place at, education institutions. Many reported
torture or intimidation during their detention.1495 Two
academics, one university staff member and a group
of researchers were also reported to have been
arrested during 2009-2012.1496 In addition, a group of
seven Southern Sudanese students was reportedly
abducted and forcibly conscripted in Khartoum by
Southern militias and taken to a training camp outside
Khartoum, but it is unclear if they were abducted at or
en route to or from campus.1497
More than half of the arrests were made during a
series of student protests and police violence that
began at the University of Khartoum in December
2011. Over the course of two months, raids on student
residences and arrests led to dozens of student
injuries and at least 552 student arrests during
protests sparked initially by the displacement
resulting from construction of the Merowe Dam.1498

188

Riot police initially injured at least 20 students and
arrested scores during a campus rally on 22 December
2011. They raided dormitories and detained 16 more
students that evening and arrested more than 100
students in a student residential compound the next
morning as demonstrations continued.1499 Some
students were injured in the arrests.1500 Several days
later, police reportedly took into custody at least 70
more when they broke up another sit-in, using tear
gas, batons and warning shots to disperse
students.1501 The university was closed on 29
December but the sit-in continued. By 1 January 2012,
three student leaders and at least four other students
had been arrested.1502 More than 300 students
continuing to stay at the university were reportedly
arrested on 17 February 2012 in pre-dawn raids on
dormitories. The university remained closed until midMarch 2012.1503
Student demonstrations were similarly suppressed at
Gezira University in early December 2012, when
authorities shut down the university after four Darfuri
students were found drowned in a nearby canal. The
four had been arrested, along with at least 50 other
students, while participating in a peaceful sit-in over
tuition fees, according to the Darfur Students
Association (DSA).1504 Dozens of other students were
reportedly injured in the first sit-in,1505 and an
additional 60 were injured in fighting between police
and students during the demonstrations that occurred
after the bodies were found.1506 The violence spread to
other universities. On 11 December 2012, in protests at
Omdurman Islamic University in Khartoum over the
same issue, around 140 students were arrested,
another 180 injured, 450 student rooms burned down,
and laptops and mobile phones allegedly looted by
security agents and supporters of Sudan’s ruling
National Congress Party (NCP).1507
Other students were similarly targeted during and
after protests or meetings at academic institutions.
Examples include the arrest on 20 April 2011 of 17
students affiliated with the United Popular Front, a
political party supporting Abdul Wahid Al Nour, a
Darfuri rebel leader, from the campus of their
university, Al Nilein, after they held a demonstration
calling for regime change in Khartoum;1508 and the
arrest on 17 January 2012 of 11 student members of the

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Democratic Unionist Party following a public talk at the
Faculty of Engineering in the University of the Nile
Valley in Al Damer.1509 Forty-two Darfuri students
reportedly resigned from the Red Sea University in
protest over arrests and harassment by security
services.1510
Students, primarily of Darfuri background, were
attacked at academic events and in academic spaces
and sometimes subsequently tortured or killed. On 11
March 2009, for example, a group identified as current
and former students and NISS officials disrupted an
authorized student forum attended by approximately
200 students at Dilling University. Ten students were
injured after being hit with sticks and iron bars.1511
Additionally, on 11 June 2009, 15 female Darfuri
students at the University of Khartoum were assaulted
by men dressed in black abayas, who had reportedly
entered their dormitory. The NISS detained many of
the women who had been assaulted, along with
others living in the same dormitory. Five of those
injured sought medical treatment at a hospital but
police forced them to leave.1512
In other cases, students of Darfuri origin and Darfur
activists were allegedly tortured by state agents. For
instance, the NISS seized a Darfuri student of the
Department of Education at the University of Khartoum
in front of the campus in early February 2010. His body,
found the next day in a street in Khartoum, showed
signs of torture, and the NISS sought to have it buried
without an autopsy, according to Amnesty
International.1513 Similarly, the body of another
student, reportedly abducted by NISS agents from the
University of Khartoum and found on 18 June 2011,
showed signs of torture; the previous day, the student
had delivered a speech about the situation in Darfur.
The NISS denied involvement.1514
Disputes between rival student movements also
turned violent. Between October 2010 and May 2012,
several clashes occurred between students
supporting rival political movements that left at least
20 students wounded,1515 one of them critically. For
example, at Nyala University, some eight students
were injured in violence between NCP-affiliated
students, who were supported by security personnel,
and pro-Sudan Liberation Movement students.1516

In another incident, on 24 May 2010, an armed group
believed to be an NCP-influenced student organization broke up an engagement party in the female
dormitories at Dalnaj University, allegedly at the
request of a dormitory supervisor. The group beat the
women with iron sticks and critically wounded a thirdyear student in the Faculty of Science. According to the
Sudan Human Rights Monitor, the student was
reportedly denied medical care by the Students
Support Fund and the dormitory administration, and
later died. The next day, a group of students demonstrating in solidarity with their peers was fired at with
live ammunition and tear gas by police forces. Two
students were killed and at least 20 injured.1517
Security services also targeted professors,
researchers and campus speakers perceived to be
undertaking controversial research or making antigovernment remarks. According to the African Centre
for Peace and Justice Studies, on 24 November 2011,
the NISS arrested and raided the offices of members of
an AIDS prevention group from Al Gezira University
that had just carried out a survey on the prevalence of
HIV and AIDS. The members were released later in the
day, but all reports and data related to the survey
conducted were confiscated and the Director-General
of the Ministry of Health suspended the research.1518
On 20 February 2012, NISS agents arrested Professor
Mohamed Zain Al-bideen, Dean of the College of
Higher Education at the University of Al Zaiem Al
Azhari in Omdurman, while leaving his university
office, and interrogated him about an article he had
written that was critical of Sudan’s President. He was
held for 15 days in a small cell and denied contact with
his family as well as a lawyer, before being released
without charge.1519

Attacks on education in 2013
During the first half of 2013, SAF aerial bombardment
of civilian targets, primarily in South Kordofan but also
in North Darfur, damaged or destroyed several
schools, injuring at least one student in the
process;1520 shelling in the area of Dresa, north-east of
East Jebel Marra, North Darfur, reportedly razed one
school to the ground in January.1521 It is not known if
these were targeted attacks.

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

A number of schools in Al Sareif Beni Hussein locality
in North Darfur were reportedly damaged or destroyed
by looting and arson during fighting between the Beni
Hussein and Abbala tribes in the first half of the
year.1522
Media sources reported that at least one secondary
school student was shot dead and another 10 or more
injured as police armed with tear gas and live
ammunition attempted to disperse protesters demonstrating over the increased cost of requirements for
sitting for the Sudan Secondary School Leaving
Certificate.1523 Another student was killed and four
more were injured outside a National Service centre
while waiting to obtain a seal required for their
university applications when a soldier fired live
ammunition after students had reportedly become
impatient over delays and perceived corruption.1524
Arrests and injury of university students by security
forces continued in 2013. By the end of September, at
least 11 university students had been injured1525 and
another 65 arrested.1526
In one incident in May, nine students sustained
injuries after being shot on the main campus of El
Fasher University, North Darfur. The students had
reportedly been attending a meeting when an
estimated 70 armed student militia members entered
the campus, trying to garner support for a government
‘mobilization’ campaign against armed opposition
groups. When the students failed to react, clashes
broke out and the militia group began firing into the
air, wounding one student. As students attempted to
flee, they were met at the campus gate by police and
NISS forces who began firing live ammunition into the
crowd, wounding eight more.1527
In September, some 22 Darfuri students were arrested
and several injured after security forces stormed the
campus of the University of Peace in Babanusa, West
Kordofan, to break up a sit-in protesting against a
university policy requiring Darfuri students to pay
tuition fees, despite a political agreement1528
exempting them from doing so. The police reportedly
used live ammunition, tear gas, batons and air rifles
against protesters.1529 The university subsequently
banned 30 Darfuri students from the university for a
period ranging from one to two years.1530

SYRIA
Schools were attacked in numerous locations. By early
2013, up to 1,000 schools had allegedly been used as
detention or torture centres and 2,445 were reported
damaged or destroyed, although it is not known how
many were targeted. Attacks on universities caused
very heavy casualties.1531

Context
Tensions rose in Syria beginning in March 2011. Some
of the first protests were sparked by the arrest and
torture of 15 boys who painted revolutionary slogans
on their school wall. After security forces killed several
protesters, more took to the streets, calling for
President Bashar al-Assad to step down.1532 By July
2011, hundreds of thousands of people were demonstrating across the country.1533 Security forces clamped
down, targeting specific groups, including schoolchildren and students. During 2011 and 2012, the
government gradually lost control of parts of the
country to the Free Syrian Army and other groups
including the Al-Nusra Front. According to the Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights, continuing conflict had
left more than 125,000 people dead by December
2013.1534 Bombings, killings, targeted attacks, arbitrary
arrests, torture, abductions and sexual violence led to
large-scale displacement of people and an unfolding
humanitarian disaster.1535
Education was hit hard by the war. Net primary
enrolment in 2011, the year the conflict began, was 93
per cent,1536 net secondary enrolment was 68 per
cent,1537 gross tertiary enrolment was 26 per cent1538
and adult literacy was 84 per cent.1539 The UN reported
in April 2013 that an estimated 2,445 of the country’s
22,000 schools were damaged or destroyed and 1,889
were being used as IDP shelters instead of for educational purposes.1540 Some 69 of 118 UNRWA schools for
Palestinian refugees were also closed.1541 A report by
the Syrian Network for Human Rights, based in
London, said 450 schools had been completely
destroyed.1542 By September 2013, almost two million
children aged 6 to 15 had dropped out of school
because of conflict and displacement.1543
The Assad regime kept tight control over the education
system. The Ba’ath party had a security unit

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

monitoring student activities at every university.
Students had no right to form an association, join a
protest or speak out in public; and university appointments were controlled by the Ba’ath party.1544 The
Syrian government prevented teachers from
expressing ideas contrary to government policy and
prohibited the teaching of the Kurdish language.1545

Attacks on schools
In reports by media and human rights sources,
including video evidence and eyewitness accounts of
individual attacks on schools, details were given of at
least 10 incidents of schools being destroyed or
partially destroyed in attacks in 2012.1546 The schools
were attacked by forces on both sides of the
conflict,1547 with some being hit by rockets and others
by shelling or air strikes. The UN Commission of
Inquiry on Syria (15 July 2012 to 15 January 2013)
documented government attacks on more than 17
schools in its 5 February 2013 report and noted that in
some cases anti-government forces were present at
the schools at the time of attack.1548
Although it is hard to determine from reports how
many of the destroyed and damaged schools were
specifically targeted, there is evidence that some were
deliberately attacked. The UN reported that
government forces looted and set fire to schools on
several occasions in 2011 in retribution for student
protests.1549 Human Rights Watch reported in mid-2013
that Syrian armed forces launched ground and air
attacks on schools that were not being used by
combatants. It said that Syrian forces fired on schools
while classes were going on inside them, using
automatic weapons and tanks, and Syrian fighter jets
and helicopters dropped bombs and incendiary
weapons on school buildings when no opposition
forces were in or near them, according to witnesses.1550
In its 2013 report Safe no more: Students and schools
under attack in Syria, Human Rights Watch reported
that one 14-year-old girl called Salma and fellow
students in Dael, Daraa governorate, hid under their
desks for protection when a tank entered their school
and sprayed the walls with machine gun fire in an
incident which took place between 19 July and 18
August 2012. Video footage viewed by arms experts at
Human Rights Watch appeared to support her account

of the attack. A soldier who defected from the Syrian
army reported that he saw a plane and a tank attack
Shaba’a High School in the suburbs of Damascus on
the first day of the school year in September 2012,
causing serious damage and injuring students.
Human Rights Watch also documented an airstrike in
Al-Bab, Aleppo governorate, on 4 November 2012, in
which four bombs struck the school while it was
hosting a civilian council, killing the head of the
council. Another witness reported that seven bombs
dropped by MiG fighters hit the playground in Ghaleb
Radi school, Quseir, Homs governorate, on 3
December 2012, releasing white smoke. Video footage
suggested they were incendiary bombs.1551

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Schoolchildren were frequently killed when schools
were targeted for attack or were damaged as a result of
collateral damage: in 2012, nine were killed in their
schoolyard in an alleged cluster bomb attack on Deir
al-Asafir,1552 and nine students and a teacher were
killed in a mortar attack on Al-Batiha school,
Damascus for example.1553
Students were arrested, detained, tortured and killed
for their participation in protests that took place in
schools.1554 Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that
security forces entered schools in Daraa, Homs and
the Damascus suburbs to collect intelligence on
students and their families, or they employed school
staff to conduct interrogations.1555 Security forces and
pro-government militias used excessive force and
even gunfire against peaceful demonstrations at three
schools, according to Human Rights Watch.1556
The UN received information that in May 2012
government forces allegedly raided the local primary
school in As Safira, Aleppo governorate, taking
hostage 30 boys and 25 girls between 10 and 13 years
of age. The forces used the children as human shields
by walking them in front of their forces to clear out a
local Free Syrian Army unit that had recently gained
control of the town.1557
UN figures suggest that by the end of February 2013, a
total of 167 education personnel, including 69
teachers, were reported to have been killed, although
it is not clear how many were targeted for attack.1558

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Military use of schools
Numerous incidents were reported of government
forces, including the Syrian Armed Forces, the intelligence forces and the Shabbiha militia, using schools
either as temporary bases, military staging grounds,
sniper posts or detention and interrogation facilities.1559 The Syrian Network for Human Rights alleged
in early 2013 that government forces had turned
approximately 1,000 schools into detention and
torture centres and used schools to house security
and intelligence personnel or as positions from which
to shell the surrounding area.1560
The opposition Free Syrian Army also used schools in
a number of areas as bases, makeshift hospitals and
detention centres, as well as for ammunition
storage.1561 For example, the UN reported that Free
Syrian Army elements in Idlib governorate used two
classrooms of the Al Shahid Wahid Al Jusef High
School as barracks for a number of days when
children were in class.1562 Human Rights Watch –
which documented military use by forces on both
sides – reported that opposition groups used schools
for barracks and command posts and that
government forces attacked schools because they
had been taken over by the opposition forces.1563
Similarly, a newspaper article alleged that a school
was bombed by rebels in 2012 because it was being
used as a base by security forces and pro-government
militia.1564

Attacks on higher education
State security forces killed students in raids on
universities and student protests. Three higher
education students were killed, 21 injured and 130
arrested during a raid of student dormitories by
security forces at Damascus University in June 2011
after students refused to participate in progovernment rallies.1565 Another student was killed
during an attack by security forces on a protest at
Damascus University in April 2011.1566 In May 2012,
four students were killed, 28 injured and 200 arrested
during a raid at Aleppo University in which teargas
and bullets were fired at protesters by security
forces.1567
Four academics were assassinated in one week in
Homs in September 2011, with responsibility for the

193

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

killings unattributed.1568 By October 2011, the number
of scholars assassinated in targeted attacks by
security forces was 10, mostly from Homs, according to
the opposition.1569

Attacks on education in 2013
As the conflict between the government of President
Bashar al-Assad and rebel groups continued into
2013, attacks persisted against Syrian schools and
universities, their students and staff. Schools were
affected by aerial attacks,1570 car bombs1571 and missile
strikes,1572 often with high numbers of victims. In
September, an incendiary bomb was dropped on the
playground of the Iqraa Institute Secondary School,
Aleppo province, killing 10 pupils and at least one
teacher and causing severe burns to 19 more
students.1573 Later that month, a fuel-air bomb landed
on a high school in Raqqa killing 15 civilians, of whom
14 were students and one was the school janitor.1574 It
has not been verified whether the schools were the
intended targets in either of these two attacks.
In higher education, two of the country’s most prestigious universities were hit by multiple explosions. Two
explosions killed at least 82 and wounded dozens
more, possibly as many as 150,1575 at Aleppo University
on the first day of mid-term examinations in
January.1576 Students and university staff were believed
to be among the dead.1577 The rebels blamed a
government air strike; the government said rebels had
attacked with rockets.1578 A mortar shell hit the café of
Damascus University’s engineering campus on 28
March, killing at least 10 students and wounding
20.1579 The government and rebels blamed each other.

THAILAND
During 2009-2012, more than 120 Buddhist and
Muslim students, teachers and education staff were
killed or wounded by insurgents in the far south, who
also did much of their recruiting in schools in 2009.
Widespread military use of schools by armed forces
and paramilitary forces made them a target for attack.

Context
Since early 2004, an insurgency by Muslim separatists
seeking autonomy in Thailand’s four southernmost
provinces – Songkhla, Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat –
has led to more than 5,000 deaths, 9,000 injuries and
human rights abuses by all sides.1580 Three of the
provinces are predominantly ethnic Malay Muslim in a
country that is 90 per cent ethnic Thai Buddhist.1581
Despite an agreement between the government of
Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and the separatist
Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) on 28 February
2013,1582 hostilities were continuing in the southern
border provinces at the end of the year.
Insurgents in the far south have carried out bombings
and shootings of security forces and civilians,
including targeted attacks against Buddhist and
Muslim teachers.1583 There have also been revenge
attacks on mosques, Islamic schools and Muslim
teashops, allegedly by Buddhist vigilantes and
security forces.1584
Elsewhere during the reporting period, Thailand was
embroiled in a bitter power struggle between the ‘Red
Shirts’, supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra who had
previously been ousted as premier by a military coup,
and the anti-Thaksin opposition ‘Yellow Shirts’ who
were supported by the military. This resulted in mass
protests and crackdowns.1585 During 2005-2011, there
was a surge in the use of lèse majesté law1586 as a
means to prevent criticism of the monarchy and to
stifle debate on reform, thus limiting academic
freedom and free speech among scholars.1587
Historically, Thai governments have used schools as a
tool to assimilate the southern population into the
Thai Buddhist mainstream. In the 1940s, the
government banned Islamic schools, Islamic attire,
the local Malay dialect, Muslim names and the
teaching of local history. Malay students were forced

194

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

to pay their respects to images of the Buddha. Such
repression and discrimination gave birth to BRN,
which has now become the backbone of the
separatist insurgency. Separatist militants still see
state schools as imposing Buddhism, Thai as a
language of instruction and Thai versions of
history.1588 During 2009-2012, in response to ongoing
violence, the provincial education authorities
switched from using Thai Buddhist teachers to
employing more local Muslim teachers and extended
the time allowed for Islamic studies.1589 Other new
measures included teaching Malay and the local
language (see Global overview).1590
Net primary enrolment in Thailand was 90 per cent
(2009),1591 net secondary enrolment was 82 per cent

province in southern Thailand, 19 April 2012.

(2011) and gross tertiary enrolment was 53 per cent
(2011). 1592 Adult literacy was 94 per cent (2005).1593

Attacks on schools
Government schools in southern Thailand were
destroyed and damaged by attacks during 2009-2012,
mostly due to buildings being set on fire or bombings.
According to the Ministry of Education, at least nine
schools were set alight in 2009.1594 The UN reported
attacks on at least five schools in 2010,1595 while in

195

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

2012, at least 11 schools were partially damaged or
destroyed by improvised explosive devices or
arson.1596 Direct attacks on military outposts set up on
school grounds were also reported.1597
Some arson cases were linked to specific political
activities. For instance, on 13 March 2009, two schools
were destroyed by insurgents in Pattani, as authorities
boosted security for the anniversary of the founding of
the BRN separatist group.1598 Other attacks on schools
appeared to be a means to target soldiers or police
officers. On 18 April 2012, Ban Ta Ngo School in Cho Ai
Rong district, Narathiwat, was set ablaze on the eve of
the Deputy Prime Minister and army chief’s visit to the
area. An explosive was then set off by remote control
targeting the team of soldiers and police who
responded to the attack.1599 In other cases, the school
itself seemed to be the target. On 29 November 2012,
a two-storey building was burned down by insurgents.
The building contained the school director’s office,
computer rooms and 11 classrooms.1600
The majority of arson attacks on schools occurred
overnight, when students and staff were not present.
However, there were some exceptions. On 3 December
2012, a group of 15-20 insurgents entered Ban Thasu
School in Panare district during the night, tied up a
temporary staff member and set fire to the school.1601
Several bombs were detonated on school premises; in
some cases, they appeared to be intended to attack
units of soldiers assigned to protect teachers. Five
teachers and two defence volunteers were wounded
by a bomb at the entrance of a school in Muang
district, Yala, on 25 July 2012. The explosive was
hidden in an iron box in front of the school.1602 In other
cases, bombs were found hidden inside fire extinguishers1603 and other spaces in or near schools. On 27
May 2012, insurgents detonated a bomb hidden in a
rest area inside Ban Kalapor School in Pattani’s
Saiburi district. The bomb was for an ambush
targeting a paramilitary unit that escorted teachers
and students. Two soldiers were killed and four others
seriously wounded. The school was closed down
immediately after the attack. Although the school was
reopened two days later, most parents refused to
bring their children back for nearly a week.1604 In
another case, on 24 September 2012, a bomb

196

exploded at the entrance of Batu Mitrapap 66 School
in Bacho district, Narathiwat province. The explosion
injured two school directors.1605

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
At least 121 Buddhist and Muslim students, teachers,
school officials and janitors were killed or wounded
during 2009-2012, according to UN figures.1606 At least
32 students and ten teachers and education
personnel were killed or injured in targeted attacks in
2009.1607 In 2010, at least two students and 12
teachers and education personnel were killed and
another five students and six teachers or education
personnel were injured.1608 At least 31 government
teachers and education personnel and one student
were killed in the southern border provinces in 2011,
and at least five teachers and three students were
wounded.1609 In 2012, the UN reported a spike of
violence in the final quarter of that year, with six
teachers killed and eight injured.1610
The vast majority of teachers and other education
personnel killed have been Thai Buddhists, but ethnic
Malay Muslim teachers at government schools and
Islamic school administrators were also targeted.1611
Many teachers requested transfers out of the southern
region due to continued insecurity.1612
Many of the teachers who were assassinated were
killed while travelling to or from work.1613 For example,
Natthapol Janae, a primary school teacher at Nikhom
Pattana Park Tai School in Bannang Sata district, Yala,
was shot dead on 19 May 2009 as he travelled to
school via motorcycle. Janae was ambushed by five
attackers on motorcycles, six kilometres from the
school.1614 In another case, a Bango Yuebang school
teacher, Samrit Panthadet, was shot in Kapho as he
returned home from school on 8 February 2010 and
gunmen burned his body.1615
Teachers who joined convoys as part of teacher-escort
programmes were not spared. On 2 June 2009,
suspected Muslim insurgents, disguised as
government soldiers, attacked a pick-up truck carrying
six teachers home from schools in Ja Nae district,
Narathiwat province. The men forced the truck to stop
at a fake roadblock set up by other gunmen in their

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

group. One Buddhist Thai teacher was shot dead and
three were wounded including Atcharapon Tehpsor
who was eight months pregnant. She died on her way
to hospital.1616 A more typical tactic was the detonation
of roadside bombs by mobile phone as security
convoys carrying teachers passed by, wounding or
killing both teachers and security personnel.1617
Some teachers were killed in ambushes on school
grounds. For example, on 11 December 2012, five men
wearing camouflage, some of them carrying assault
rifles, invaded the canteen of Ban Ba Ngo School in
Mayo district, Pattani. They shot dead two Buddhist
teachers after isolating them from five Muslim
teachers. At one point, the school’s Buddhist head
teacher tried to hide behind one of the Muslim
teachers, but he was still shot at close range. The other
Buddhist teacher was also shot dead.1618 According to
insurgent sources, this attack was in retaliation for an
alleged Buddhist vigilante attack on a Muslim teashop
in Narathiwath’s Ra Ngae district earlier that day.1619
Attacks on teachers often forced school closures in
response. For instance, after the head teacher of the
Tha Kam Cham School in Nong Chik district, Pattani
province, was killed in November 2012, the
Confederation of Teachers of Southern Border
Provinces closed 332 schools in the region for 10
days.1620 As a result of the 11 December 2012 killings,
the Confederation closed 1,300 government schools
serving more than 200,000 students in Pattani, Yala,
and Narathiwat provinces. The Confederation
additionally closed four districts of Songkhla for
another two days.1621
Other education personnel, such as teacher assistants and janitors, have also been targeted by
separatist insurgents. For example, a Muslim teacher
assistant at Ban Budee School in Pattani’s Yaring
district was shot dead by insurgents while returning
home on his motorcycle in Pattani’s Mayo district on
26 May 2013.1622 On 11 June 2013, a janitor at Ban Than
Mali School in Yala’s Betong district was shot dead by
insurgents as he was riding his motorcycle back
home.1623
Generally, students were not targeted, but sometimes
they were casualties. On 27 September 2011, for
instance, two students were wounded by shrapnel

when a roadside bomb hit their school bus while
being escorted by a military vehicle in Narathiwat’s
Yee Ngor district. Police believed that insurgents
intended the bomb to hit soldiers escorting the
students.1624

Military use of schools
To accommodate the additional military and paramilitary forces that the Thai government deployed in the
southern provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala,
camps were established inside school buildings and
compounds. Security forces occupied at least 79
schools in 2010,1625 and continued to use schools as
barracks and bases for at least the next year.1626 In
2011, reacting to domestic and international concerns,
the army reportedly ordered security units to stop
using government schools as barracks.1627
Military outposts at schools were targeted for attack,
putting the schools at risk. On 18 March 2011, ethnic
Malay Muslim insurgents attacked an outpost of the
Pattani Task Force 21 at a school in Yarang district,
killing one soldier. Attackers climbed over the fence of
Sano Pitthayakhom School in Tambon and opened fire
at the operations base of the 3rd Rifle Platoon of the
8023rd Infantry Company; they fled after soldiers
returned fire.1628 The military base at Ban Langsad
School in Tambon Ka Sor was attacked by suspected
insurgents on 6 December 2012. M-79 grenade explosions damaged the school wall.1629 Grenades were
also used in June 2012 to attack a school in
Krongpinang district during a security briefing in the
schoolyard; three soldiers were killed.1630
The presence of security forces in schools made
schools a target for attack and in some cases caused
parents to keep their children at home.1631 For
instance, local people removed children from Ban
Klong Chang elementary school, Pattani, after 30
Rangers established a camp in the back of the school
compound in 2010. Parents feared that the presence
of soldiers would increase the risk of attack, and staff
and students complained of overcrowding, inability to
use school latrines and the poor behaviour of
soldiers.1632
Security forces also conducted raids in search of
suspected insurgents and weapons at Islamic

197

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

schools, some of which turned violent or resulted in
arbitrary mass arrests.1633 On 4 September 2012, the
government’s Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO)
seized the assets of an Islamic religious school in
Narathiwat province for allegedly using the school as a
centre for making bombs.1634

Child recruitment from schools
The International Crisis Group reported in 2009 that
insurgents did much of their recruiting at Islamic
schools.1635 The most active separatist group, the
National Revolutionary Front-Coordinate (BRN-C),
selected students from Islamic primary schools and
private Islamic schools for after-school indoctrination
programmes, carried out within special religious
lessons, educational trips and team sports activities
such as football. Recruiters used the activities to
assess who were the most suitable individuals to join
the movement. According to a police interview in
2009, a BRN-C plan outlined how school compounds
were used to give recruits fitness training before they
could progress to military and combat training. Mostly,
children were given non-military jobs such as intelligence gathering, laying spikes on the road, graffiti
painting and arson.1636

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education came largely in the form
of threats toward professors related to lèse majesté
law1637 and the detention of students following
protests.
Several professors were detained or threatened on
charges of lèse majesté under article 112 of the Penal
Code and under the Computer Crime Act. An assistant
professor at Chulalongkorn University, Dr Suthachai
Yamprasert, was detained by the Thai authorities for
seven days in May 2010 and interrogated at the Centre
for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation
(CRES)1638 because his name was on a CRES list of
people suspected of conspiring to overthrow the
monarchy.1639 In another case, Somsak
Jeamteerasakul, a professor of history at Thammasat
University, received threatening phone calls and visits
following a speech he made about reforming the
monarchy.1640 On 11 May 2011, he reported to police at
Bangkok’s Nang Lerng Police Station to acknowledge

198

the charges filed by the army over two articles he had
written in response to a televised interview by
Princess Chulabhorn.1641
Two professors were also threatened due to their
attempts to reform lèse majesté laws. Pavin
Chachavalpongpun, an associate professor at Kyoto
University, has led a campaign from outside Thailand
to modify Article 112 of the laws. On 12 June 2012, he
received two anonymous phone calls from Thailand
threatening him if he continued the campaign.1642
Worachet Pakeerut, an assistant professor of law at
Thammasat University and member of a group of law
professors that has campaigned to liberalize lèse
majesté laws, was assaulted by two men outside his
university in March 2012.1643
Three student leaders, including the secretary-general
of the Student Federation of Thailand, were
summoned and interrogated by the CRES on 2 May
2010 and were questioned about their political
leanings and acquaintances.1644

Attacks on education in 2013
Attacks on teachers, education staff and soldiers
protecting schools continued in 2013. On 17 January, a
school minivan driver was killed by shots to his head
and torso by two men riding a motorcycle. The attack
happened while he was taking seven students to
kindergarten.1645 On 23 January, two militants walked
into a Narathiwat school dining hall and shot dead a
teacher in front of dozens of students.1646
In February 2013, the government and insurgents
agreed to begin peace talks and in July they
announced a 40-day ceasefire during Ramadan,1647
although this did not prevent further abuses against
civilians by suspected militants. On 29 April, it was
reported that a teacher and another man on security
duty at Buke Bakong School in Narathiwat were
injured when militants opened fire on them;1648 and on
24 July, two Muslim teachers were killed and one
seriously injured when the car they were travelling to
school in was blown up.1649 On 21 August, a teacher
was killed by gunfire while on his way home, resulting
in the temporary closure of 12 schools.1650
Separatist bomb, arson, gun and grenade attacks,
both at and near educational establishments, also

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

continued with frequency.1651 Often they had fatal
consequences for the soldiers protecting schools.1652
Atypically, in what may have been a revenge attack, an
Islamic religious teacher who worked at an Islamic
school, and who had overseen Islamic elementary
schools based in villages for four years, was shot and
killed by men riding a motorcycle in Pattani. It was not
known who killed him1653 but Human Rights Watch,
citing his case, urged the government to investigate
the murders of ethnic Malays to allay fears of state
inaction over perceived reprisal attacks.1654

Turkish ethnic bias, would no longer be obligatory in
primary schools.1659 In addition, the ban on
headscarves in the civil service, including for teachers
in schools and universities, a contentious issue
between secularists and advocates of religious
freedom, would be lifted.1660
Net primary enrolment was 96 per cent, net secondary
enrolment was 85 per cent, and gross tertiary
enrolment was 61 per cent (2011). Adult literacy was 91
per cent (2009).1661

Attacks on schools

TURKeY
Two dozen schools were bombed or set on fire and
28 teachers abducted in 2010-2012, mostly in the
south-east, where Kurdish insurgents were active.
Hundreds of university students were arrested in
protests that were suppressed with excessive use
of force.1655

Context
During 2009-2012, the long-running insurgency led by
the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) continued in southeastern Turkey. Armed clashes between the PKK and
the Turkish military escalated in 2011 but in 2013 there
was a ceasefire in the context of a peace process.
The government restricted the right to protest and
constraints on academic freedom continued. There
was a deepening polarization between the religious
conservative government and the secularist
Republican People’s Party.1656 Police violence against
demonstrators continued and protesters, including
students, were beaten at protests. Academics were
arrested in the context of investigations into coup
plots against the government and serious violations of
due process occurred during the controversial trials
that followed. There were also arrests of academics in
association with the Kurdish issue.
On 30 September 2013, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan
announced a package of legal reforms, two of them
relevant to education for Kurdish students and
teachers.1657 Instruction would be allowed in minority
languages, including Kurdish, in private schools but
not in the state sector.1658 An oath of national
allegiance, to which many Kurds objected due to its

Media reports suggest that there were at least two
dozen attacks on schools from 2009 to 2012,1662
mainly in south-eastern Turkey. In one incident,
attackers shouted pro-PKK slogans but in many cases
the perpetrators were not identified. Kurdish militants
were assumed to target schools because they
believed they were being used as tools of assimilation. The majority of attacks were fire-bombings.1663
For instance, it was reported that on 9 October 2012, a
student and two teachers were injured when masked
men threw Molotov cocktails at a high school in
Diyarbakir.1664 During a two-week spate of attacks in
October 2012, suspected PKK activists set at least 20
schools on fire1665 including a kindergarten.1666
A car bomb suspected to have been detonated by the
PKK exploded outside a secondary school in Ankara in
September 2011, killing three people; the schoolyard
was used to treat the injured.1667

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
According to a compilation of media reports, 28
teachers were abducted in 2011-2012,1668 including 12
in one week.1669 Most were kidnapped by PKK
members; many were released shortly afterwards. In
one incident, armed militants broke into a teachers’
staff room and kidnapped six of the 19 teachers
present but released them under pressure from local
people.1670
In one incident in December 2011, a group of PKK
supporters reportedly threw Molotov cocktails and
stones at a housing unit for dozens of teachers, yelling
at them to leave the area and threatening to burn
them.1671

199

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

Media and trade union reports suggest that more than
40 teacher trade unionists in the teachers’ union
Eğitim Sen were arrested or detained as state authorities suppressed union activism including on the right
to education in Kurdish.1672 Twenty-seven teacher
trade unionists arrested in May 2009 were charged
with providing intellectual support to illegal organizations.1673 In October 2011, 25 teacher trade unionists
were sentenced to six years and five months’ imprisonment under anti-terrorism laws. According to the
International Trade Union Confederation, the evidence
against them included the possession of books that
were freely available in bookshops and the holding of
trade union meetings.1674

Attacks on higher education
Police beat and used excessive force against students
during two demonstrations against government
higher education and other policies, one held in
central Istanbul in early December 20101675 and the
other at Middle East Technical University on 18
December 2012. At the second protest, the police
allegedly fired 2,000 tear gas canisters, pepper spray
and water cannon at the 300 gathered students,
causing injury, according to the International Human
Rights Network of Academics and Scholarly Societies
(IHRNASS).1676
The research group GIT Turkey reported in June 2012
that there had been an increase in academics’ rights
violations in recent years and noted that those who
suffered most were academics working on subjects
deemed sensitive by the government, particularly
Kurdish and minority issues.1677
Kemal Gürüz, a leading republican secularist and a
former president of both the Turkish Higher Education
Council (YÖK) and the Turkish science-funding agency
TÜBITAK, was one of many people accused of plotting
to overthrow the elected government in a case that
was opened after a cache of grenades and other
explosives was found in the home of a retired noncommissioned Turkish army officer. The IHRNASS
reported that there was no evidence supporting the
claims in relation to Gürüz, who believed he was jailed
because of his stance on secularism. As head of YÖK,
he implemented a ban on wearing headscarves in
universities which Prime Minister Erdogan’s party

200

strongly opposed.1678 He was sentenced to 13 years
and nine months in jail. In September 2013, he was
released pending an appeal.1679

Attacks on education in 2013
A bomb exploded at a school in Cizre in January
injuring three students, but the perpetrator was
unknown.1680
In September and October, police used rubber bullets,
tear gas and water cannon against Middle East
Technical University students protesting against a
road planned through their campus.1681
The acquittal of sociologist Pinar Selek on terrorism
charges was overturned in 2013 and she was given a
life sentence. An advocate for the rights of socially
disadvantaged children and women who has
researched Kurdish groups, she had been repeatedly
arrested and tried on allegations of participating in a
1998 explosion at a spice market. Court investigations
found that the explosion resulted from an accidental
gas leak rather than a bomb and, in the 14 years
following the incident, Selek was acquitted three
times of terrorism charges due to lack of admissible
evidence.1682 She was also allegedly tortured to elicit
the names of her interview participants in contravention of the ethics rules governing research, and in
contravention of domestic and international law.1683

YeMeN
There was widespread destruction of schools in direct
attacks, including air strikes, bombing, shelling and
looting, as well as in general fighting and in clashes
during protests. Schools and universities were used as
barracks, bases and firing positions.1684

Context
A political crisis in 2009 between the ruling General
People’s Congress party and the main opposition
bloc, the Joint Meeting Parties, led to the
postponement of parliamentary elections.1685 In 2009,
the country witnessed fighting break out again
between the army and rebels from the Houthi
community in the far north, as well as escalating
protests by supporters of independence or greater
autonomy for southern Yemen, and the emergence of

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), an affiliate
of the global terrorism network, Al-Qaeda.1686
Inspired by the Arab Spring, student groups took a
prominent role in the uprising from February 2011,1687
peacefully occupying ‘Change Square’ in front of
Sana’a University, which became a focal point for
protesters.1688 Following a military crackdown on
civilian protests, pro- and anti-government forces
fought each other sporadically in 2011.1689 AQAP
militants, meanwhile, took over key areas of the
south. However, a US-backed offensive in April and
May 2012 drove the militants out of their strongholds
in Zinjibar and Jaar city, Abyan governorate, and the
Azzan area in Shabwa governorate.1690 Meanwhile, a
comprehensive set of agreements, including the Gulf
Cooperation Council’s Initiative and the Agreement on
the Implementation Mechanism for the Transition,
was brokered after ten months of protest, ushering in
a two-year period of political transition.1691
Attacks on schools and other education-related
incidents involving violence and the use of force were
a significant concern and sometimes a growing trend
during 2009-2012, affecting schools in different parts
of Yemen at different times. Between 2009 and 2012,
there were at least 720 incidents affecting schools,
including direct attacks, looting, threats and military
use of schools, according to the UN SecretaryGeneral’s annual reports on children and armed
conflict.1692 Additionally, data supplied by a UN
respondent for 2011 and 2012 suggest that there could
have been as many as 853 incidents in total in 20092012.1693 It is not known how many of them were
targeted attacks.1694
In education, gross enrolment was 97 per cent at
primary level, 46 per cent at secondary level and 10
per cent at tertiary level (2011).1695 Adult literacy was
65 per cent (2011).1696

Attacks on schools
From August 2009 to February 2010, attacks on and
damage to schools increased in the far north during
the war between the army and Houthi rebels in Sa’ada
governorate on the border with Saudi Arabia. The
Director of the Education Office in Sa’ada, Muhammad
Abdul Rahim Al-Shamiri, reported that out of the

governorate’s 725 schools, all of which were closed
during the war, 70 were almost completely
destroyed1697 and another 145 were partially destroyed
or looted.1698 Ahmed Al-Qurashi, director of the NGO
Seyaj Organization for Childhood Protection,
confirmed that schools in the Sa’ada governorate were
targeted during this period, as were other places used
to teach children while schools were closed, such as
tents, mosques and houses.1699
According to the UN, by the end of 2010, some 311
schools in Sa’ada had been partially or completely
destroyed because of shelling and crossfire during
clashes between the parties to the conflict, but again
it was not specified how many had been targeted.1700
In two separate incidents, unexploded ordnance was
sighted in schools in Malaheed in Sa’ada governorate.
Away from the conflict in Sa’ada, three bombs were
found in a girls’ school in Aden Governorate in the far
south.1701
During 2011, there was a spike in school attacks and
school-related incidents away from the Houthi conflict
area, following a general increase in unrest after the
protests demanding reforms. According to the UN,
attacks included looting, shelling, aerial
bombardment, arson and intimidation.1702 According
to Seyaj Organization for Childhood Protection, whose
staff visited dozens of schools immediately after they
had been attacked in 2011, incidents also included
IEDs planted in schools, detonators attached to
school doors and rocket damage.1703 They also saw
nine schools in Abyan that had been hit in airstrikes by
Yemeni forces after militants linked to Al-Qaeda used
them for military purposes.1704 The UN reported 211
incidents affecting 150 schools that year. The Sana’a
region was particularly affected with at least 130
incidents affecting 77 schools, and there were 72
incidents in Tai’zz in the southern highlands.1705 On 19
October 2011, a school in Ta’izz was seriously
damaged by pro-government armed men, who tried to
burn it down. At least seven students who protested
against the entry of the armed elements into the
school were injured.1706
Armed groups such as the First Armoured Division – a
breakaway division supporting anti-government
protesters – and militias associated with the Al-Ahmar

201

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

tribe were chiefly responsible for the attacks. As noted
below (see Military use of schools), both government
and anti-government forces used schools for military
purposes, which reportedly provoked numerous
attacks. The attacks and school closures due to
fighting disrupted the education of 200,000 children
in 2011.1707
In November-December 2011, there was a steep rise in
reporting of attacks on schools to the UN due to rapid
assessment missions conducted by the Child
Protection Sub-cluster and the Yemeni Department of
Education. They reported 204 incidents of schools
being looted, shelled, aerially bombarded and set on
fire; education personnel being threatened; and
schools being used for military purposes.1708
In January-February 2012, 13 schools used as polling
stations were attacked or otherwise damaged, for
example, when government forces clashed with
members of the southern separatist movement AlHirak in or around school buildings. In other cases,
militants looted schools or threw sound bombs to
prevent people from entering to vote.1709
On 24 April 2012, a grenade was launched at a school
in which IDPs were sheltering in Aden district.1710
Attacks on education in 2012 peaked in May and June,
with 181 of the 252 incidents reported that year.1711 Half
of those took place in Sana’a, where the government
continued to fight anti-government forces intermittently, including 44 cases of bombs exploding in the
vicinity of schools.1712 In the same period, there were
78 incidents affecting Abyan’s schools as the military
cracked down on AQAP fighters in the area.1713 Those
responsible included the Republican Guards, antigovernment tribal groups and Ansar Al-Sharia (a
militant Islamic group connected to AQAP).1714
Between July and October 2012, a few isolated
incidents were reported. For instance, on 27 July 2012,
Houthi armed militants stormed into Omar Ibn AlKhattab primary school where students were
attending summer classes, and demanded that they
study the Houthi handbook.1715 On 29 September
2012, in Abyan, a group of armed students allegedly
associated with Ansar Al-Sharia entered school facilities, burning textbooks and destroying furniture to
disrupt the classes.1716

202

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
From 2009 to 2012, attacks on students, teachers and
other education staff included killings, torture,
assaults, illegal detention and threats of violence.
Some 122 teachers were killed and 300 injured in
2009-2012, nearly all of them during the 2011 protests
or during conflict between tribes and Houthi rebels in
Jawf governorate in the far north, according to the
Yemeni Teachers’ Syndicate (YTS).1717 It is not known
how many of those attacks were targeted.
In addition, the YTS documented other abuses by
Houthi rebels, mostly in Sa’ada governorate, also in
the north, as well as by state armed forces or security
forces. Abuses by Houthi forces included four teachers
allegedly killed for sectarian reasons, 29 teachers
imprisoned, 11 tortured, 11 kidnapped and six
assaulted.Alleged abuses by state forces included
two teachers disappeared during protests; other
teachers received death threats or were illegally
detained or harassed.1718
The YTS said there was evidence that some abuses by
Houthi rebels were carried out for sectarian reasons,
against those who rejected their beliefs, as threats to
teachers from Houthi rebels issued by text messages
indicated.1719 Muhammad Al-Shamiri said Houthi
rebels went into schools and ordered teachers and
students to chant Houthi slogans and use pro-Shiite
texts, and attacked them and closed down the school
if they refused.1720 The Houthis follow Zaidism, a
moderate school of Shia Islam.
Houthi rebels targeted leading education figures in
2012. Al-Shamiri himself, as Director of Sa’ada
Education Office, received death threats and was
forced to flee the city in February 2012. A threat
received by text message stated: ‘Your death is very
close’. He knew of no reason why he was threatened
other than as a teacher who managed and supervised
other teachers, at a time when teachers were being
targeted. Al-Shamiri understood the threats to have
come from Houthi forces who had threatened him
before.1721 Ebrahim Dhaiban, the YTS chairman in
Sa’ada, was illegally detained by Houthi rebels on his
way home from work in late November 2012.1722

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Military use of schools
According to the UN Secretary-General’s annual
reports on children and armed conflict, in 2009-2012
at least 52 schools were used for military purposes,
with 16 used as bases and 36 used for storage of
military weapons by combatants.1723 Most of the
incidents documented by the UN were related either to
the Houthi conflict or the activities of opposing
military forces during the anti-government protests.
However, information provided by a UN respondent
and other sources suggests that the total number of
schools used for military purposes may have been
much higher than the figures appearing in the UN
Secretary-General’s reports.
In 2009, during fighting between Houthi rebels and
Yemeni forces in Sa’ada governorate and neighbouring areas, there were reports that dozens of
schools were being used by combatants from both
sides.1724 This equated to most schools in the affected
areas and halted the education of some 30,000
primary and secondary schoolchildren.1725 The
presence of combatants also resulted in some schools
being attacked and 17 were completely destroyed. The
Ministry of Education had to cancel the school year in
the affected areas, Sa’ada and Harf Sufyan.1726
In October 2011, Reuters, the international news
agency, reported that at least 50 schools in Sana’a had
closed because of the unrest that followed protests for
reform. Of these, the majority were reportedly seized
by armed gunmen.1727 Similarly, UNICEF documented
that armed forces and armed groups had occupied at
least 54 schools in 2011.1728
In addition, Seyaj Organization for Child Protection
reported that, during March-October 2011, schools
came under direct attack after they were used by prouprising tribal fighters, pro-former regime forces and
Al-Qaeda-linked militants as fighting positions, places
of military training and ammunition stores.1729
In 2012, according to a UN respondent, at least 58
schools were occupied; six of them in Hasaba, a
district of Sana’a, were used by armed forces and
various armed groups, and 52 were used by Ansar AlSahria in Abyan for about four months until mid-June,
when the group lost control over the governorate.

According to the source, the majority of these schools
were heavily contaminated with explosives and
became targets of attacks by opposing forces.1730 The
UN Secretary-General reported that during an
offensive in the first half of 2012, Yemeni armed forces
allegedly shelled schools in Abyan that were occupied
by Ansar Al-Sharia. At least 19 schools were either
partially or totally destroyed.1731 A similar incident was
reported in Aden.1732
In March 2012, Human Rights Watch visited five
schools in Sana’a that were partially occupied, two
that were completely occupied, seven that had previously been fully or partially occupied and one that was
closed because of the military presence near the
school. By early September, all of the schools had
been cleared. The occupiers were: the Al-Ahmar tribal
militia, the renegade First Armoured Division and the
Yemeni army.1733 It found that two buildings at Asma’a
School, a girls’ school near Change Square, were
being used by between 70 and 100 soldiers of the First
Armoured Division, who were living on the campus.
They first moved onto the school campus in July 2011
and did not leave until August 2012, despite classes
continuing at the school. At another school, Al-Faaruq
School, close to the President’s residence in Sana’a,
Presidential Guards set up sandbag and concrete fortifications on the roof and used them as observation
points and firing positions, despite classes for 2,000
children continuing at the school. Both of these
schools were subsequently vacated.1734
There were reports in December 2012 of Houthi forces
taking over an unknown number of schools in Al-Saif
and Haja for use as detention facilities.1735

Child recruitment from schools
The general phenomenon of recruitment of children by
armed forces and armed groups in education settings
has been documented but the numbers of children
recruited have not been established, nor have the
numbers recruited from schools or en route to or from
school.
Shawthab Organization, a local child rights NGO,
reported Houthis handing out leaflets to schoolchildren encouraging them to join the armed group
Shabab al-Mo’mineem (Believing Youth).1736 They said

203

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

the recruitment campaign focused on teenagers in
grades 8 to 12 on the grounds that they would be
easier to influence than adult recruits.1737 Muhammad
Ezan, a political analyst, noted that students and
teachers were used as Houthi recruiters in Sa’ada. He
added that there was no evidence of forcible
recruitment or abduction.1738

According to University World News, pro-government
gunmen killed or injured students protesting near the
university,1746 and clashes erupted in front of the
university between students and youths and
government supporters armed with daggers and
batons.1747

Attacks on higher education

There were at least two cases of the use of higher
education facilities by combatants. The First Armoured
Division rebel forces occupied Sana’a University’s Old
Campus in 2011. The university was closed from
February 2011 until January 2012 when the first
students started to return, but the rebels remained on
campus, even using the cafeteria, until April 2012.1748
From early June to December 2011, Central Security
forces and Republican Guards occupied the Superior
Institute for Health Science in Ta’izz, a college for
pharmacists and physicians’ assistants that was
located on high ground.1749

Attacks on higher education facilities
There was one reported direct attack on a higher
education institution during 2009-2012. On 27
November 2011, Houthi rebels reportedly killed 20
people and wounded 70 others in an attack on a Sunni
Islamist school in northern Yemen.1739 The school, Dar
al-Hadith, an institute for Islamic Salafi teachings,
trained Sunni preachers in the Houthi stronghold of
Dammaj, Sa’ada governorate. One teacher speculated
that the attack was motivated by a fear of Sunnis
converting Shias in the area.1740 It was reported by the
Switzerland-based human rights NGO Alkarama that
the centre was under siege for two weeks before the
attack, preventing the delivery of food and medical
supplies.1741 One 18-year-old student was shot on 4
November 2011 while playing football with colleagues
in the institute’s courtyard.1742
At Sana’a University, students with opposed political
stances forcibly shut down their rivals’ classes in
March 2011.1743
Attacks on higher education students, academics
and personnel
Between February and October 2011, 73 higher
education students were killed nationally and 139
wounded, 38 of whom were permanently disabled as a
result of their injuries, according to the Wafa
Organization for Martyrs’ Families and Wounded
Care.1744 It is not known how many of these killings and
injuries occurred on campus or in the vicinity of universities, or because the victims were being targeted as
students. However, the Yemen Students Union
reported that there were some deaths and high
numbers of injuries from gunshot wounds among the
students camped in Change Square, in front of Sana’a
University’s entrance, who were boycotting lectures as
part of a protest demanding a change of president.1745

204

Military use of higher education facilities

Attacks on education in 2013
According to a UN respondent, attacks on schools fell
significantly in 2013 compared to 2012.1750 The UN
verified that on 23 February, Houthi fighters stormed
into the Imam Hadi primary school in Sharmat,
Sa’ada, demanding to keep one prisoner inside the
school temporarily and, when the request was
refused, opened fire, wounding a teacher;1751 and that
in July, Houthi rebels armed with machine guns
occupied a school in Dammaj district.1752 On 27
September 2013, Jabir Ali Hamdan, a teacher at the
Sa’ada School in Maeen area in Razih, was reportedly
imprisoned and threatened with death after he had
broken a stick on which the Houthi slogan of Al-Sarkha
(‘God is Great/Death to America/Death to Israel/Curse
the Jews/Victory to Islam’1753) was written. He was later
released.1754
There were continuing local media reports of incidents
of Houthi rebels shooting school staff, threatening
teachers and taking over schools, mostly in Sa’ada
governorate,1755 and of attacks on students and
teachers by other armed groups or armed gangs in
other Yemeni governorates, but these have not been
confirmed by UN or human rights sources. They
included the shooting of teachers and students as

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

well as bombings and shootings at examination
centres. The incidents were reported in Sana’a1756 and
the Ta’izz,1757 Hodeida and Hajja governorates,1758 as
well as in Lani province.1759

ZIMBABWe
Hundreds of university students were unlawfully
arrested or unlawfully detained during 2009-2012, and
police and state security forces violently repressed
several protests at universities. School teachers faced
intimidation and death threats, and some schools were
used as militia bases.1760

Context
Zimbabwe experienced ongoing political violence
after the emergence in 1999 of the political party the
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to challenge
Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union –
Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) for power.1761 This violence
was particularly intense during election periods.1762
According to a study by the Progressive Teachers
Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ), one in two teachers
surveyed had directly experienced political violence
between 2000 and 2012.1763 Most reported that this
violence took place during the school day.1764 The
Student Solidarity Trust (SST) reported 211 cases of
abduction and torture of university students from
2006 to 2010.1765
In the build-up to the 2008 presidential elections and
during their aftermath, attacks on teachers and
teacher trade unionists, including killings, arrests,
incarcerations, destruction of homes, torture and
threats of violence, were reported.1766 Many schools
became sites for enforced political rallies in which
teachers and head teachers were repeatedly and
publicly threatened with death.1767
The political situation changed in 2008, when Morgan
Tsvangirai, of the MDC, and President Mugabe came to
a power-sharing agreement that lasted until elections
in July 2013, which Mugabe won by a landslide.1768
During 2009-2012, there were incidents of political
pressure on students and teachers and political use of
schools, mostly implicating Zanu-PF supporters, but in
one reported incident the MDC was involved.1769

For example, pupils and teachers were ordered to
attend a Zanu-PF rally held at Mount Carmel School in
May 2011, forcing several schools in Manicaland
province to shut on a weekday.1770 In another incident,
the MDC organized a rally at Pagwashi Primary School
in the Cashel Valley of Chimanimani East that was
allegedly disrupted by Zanu-PF supporters, creating a
situation that police warned was volatile.1771
Schools were reportedly used in the Zanu-PF
campaign against international sanctions, despite a
government directive prohibiting it.1772 On one
occasion, a senior education official in Chikomba
district, Mashonaland East province, ordered that all
schools be employed for signing an anti-sanctions
petition and that head teachers act as unpaid polling
officers to oversee the exercise.1773
There are no recent figures for primary or secondary
enrolment. In 2011, gross tertiary enrolment was 6 per
cent and the adult literacy rate was 84 per cent.1774

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
A compilation of media and human rights reports
suggests numerous teachers faced harassment,
expulsion, threats of political violence and death
because Zanu-PF supporters accused them of
supporting the MDC.
In 2009, local militia and tribal leaders allegedly
forced schools to provide them with offices and
appointed ‘youth coordinators’ and school prefects
without permission from education authorities. In
these positions, they allegedly intimidated teachers in
school, leading them to fear for their security, and kept
the youth militia informed of activities within the
schools.1775
In November 2010, PTUZ said Zanu-PF supporters led
by war veterans were trying to ‘cleanse’ Mashonaland
province of teachers after President Mugabe
announced that elections might be held the following
year. PTUZ cited the case of six teachers who were
forcibly transferred to other schools in Zanu-PF strongholds and feared for their lives. There was a history of
war veterans and Zanu-PF supporters accusing
teachers of supporting the MDC and targeting them
with political violence.1776

205

PART III — COUNTRY PROFILeS

In February 2011, the MDC alleged that war veteran
leader Jabulani Sibanda closed schools across a
whole district in Masvingo and forced teachers and
schoolchildren to attend his pro-Zanu-PF meeting,
where he said MDC members would be killed. He had
reportedly used the same tactics in other parts of
Masvingo, Mashonaland Central and Manicaland
provinces over the previous year.1777 The PTUZ
confirmed that teachers in Gutu had left their jobs
because of death threats from Sibanda. 1778
There were also several reports of Zanu-PF militia
imposing their ideology on school curricula. In some
cases, Zanu-PF leaders forced teachers to attend ‘reeducation camps’, allegedly so that they could
‘experience the pain and suffering endured by liberation war heroes’.1779 The threat of violence was
ever-present, as Zanu-PF set up bases in some areas to
intimidate, beat and torture people who refused to
comply with their demands.1780 PTUZ claimed that
history teachers found it hard to teach the subject
without being accused of attacking Zanu-PF and
avoided teaching ‘true history’ for their own
safety.1781 In one case, a head teacher was told that war
veterans were going to visit his school to teach
history.1782
Zanu-PF supporters threatened at least one head
teacher and two teachers because they accepted gifts
or grants for their schools from political opponents of
Zanu-PF. A head teacher at Mapor Primary School,
Mutare North, fled, fearing for his life, when Zanu-PF
came looking for him at the school after they learned
that he had accepted funds under the Constituency
Development Fund (CDF) from an MDC-T senator.1783
Two teachers left Chatindo Primary School in Nyanga
North after Zanu-PF youths threatened them for
accepting five rolls of barbed wire paid for by the
CDF.1784

Military use of schools
Although the exact number is unknown, human rights
organizations found evidence of some schools being
used as bases by militia groups, including Zanu-PF
youth militia, in Masvingo province, Manicaland
province and several other rural areas. In one incident,
Zanu-PF youth militia allegedly camped at Chikurudzo
primary and secondary schools in Masvingo North,

206

causing fear among teachers and schoolchildren by
threatening to set up torture bases on the premises.1785
In another, a militia base was set up at Chifamba
Primary School in Guruve South, Mashonaland Central
province, where militia members conducted night
patrols and political meetings and forced people to
attend Zanu-PF events.1786 In August 2011,
Zimbabwean human rights groups indicated that
some 200 youth militia members were being trained at
Sherenje Secondary School in Manicaland
province.1787 War veterans and the Simudza Makoni
youth group, allegedly linked to Zanu-PF politician
Didymus Mutasa, also reportedly seized control of
Rainbow Crèche in Rusape, forcing its staff to flee.1788

Attacks on higher education
Reports suggest that police and security forces used
excessive violence to quell student protests on several
occasions, resulting in at least two deaths and 641789
injuries.1790 For example, in September 2010, two
students reportedly died after being brutally assaulted
by security guards and ‘unknown assailants’ who
sought to prevent students with unpaid fees from
attending a graduation ceremony at Bindura
University. Sixteen other students were injured,
according to the Zimbabwe National Students’
Union.1791 In a separate incident, around 10 students
from Great Zimbabwe University were reportedly
beaten by police for pressing other students to join a
boycott of lectures.1792
The Student Solidarity Trust reported seven cases of
abduction and torture of university students from
January 2009 to July 2012.1793 In one incident, two
students were organizing a protest against high fees at
Masvingo Polytechnic when Central Intelligence
Organisation agents allegedly arrested and tortured
them. The students then had to pay an ‘admission of
guilt’ fine to be released.1794
At least one academic was reported to have been
tortured during detention by the Zimbabwean authorities. On 5 December 2012, a lecturer at Bindura
University was arrested, put in solitary confinement
and tortured for claiming in a research paper that
police had been ordered not to arrest Zanu-PF
members committing crimes during the 2008
conflict.1795

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

According to the SST, 359 students were unlawfully
arrested between January 2009 and July 2012 and 349
were unlawfully detained in the same period.1796 It is
not known how many of these cases overlap.

In two other incidents, student leaders were arrested
for talking to students on campus. In January 2013,
Zimbabwe National Students’ Union (Zinasu)
secretary-general Tryvine Musokeri and two other
Zinasu leaders were arrested at Harare Polytechnic for
addressing a crowd of students. They criticized
government failure to provide students with grants
and loans.1802 In February 2013, a Gweru magistrate
acquitted Zinasu president Pride Mkono and his
deputy, Musokeri, on charges of violating the Public
Order and Security Act after they were arrested for
addressing students at Midlands State University the
previous year.1803

Source: Student Solidary Trust

In February 2010, it was reported that ten students,
including four student union officers, were arrested by
police and security guards during a meeting to discuss
grievances at the University of Zimbabwe.1797 In
another case, police detained five student leaders
after one commented that President Mugabe was
delaying political progress; the students were
reportedly beaten while in custody, including with
whips and batons.1798

Attacks on education in 2013
The PTUZ reported that teachers were intimidated with
threats of physical harm into supporting a particular
political party during the parliamentary and presidential elections in July. The union said that in
Mashonaland Central province teachers were drafted
into ZANU-PF structures and forced to campaign for the
party against their will. On voting day, they were told
that they should plead illiteracy so that they could be
‘assisted’ to vote by ZANU-PF supporters. In
Mashonaland West, the teachers were forced to
withdraw their membership from the PTUZ as the
organization complained about the harassment of
teachers.1799 The Zimbabwe Election Support Network
reported as an illustrative critical incident during the
voting process the fact that some known teachers in
Chimanimani East, Manicaland, asked for assistance

Initial figures are drawn from the Reports of the Secretary-General on Children
and Armed Conflict 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013. The figure 542 derives from 509
attacks in 2011 and 2012 reported by a UN respondent plus 17 schools reported
destroyed in 2009 and 16 reported used for military purposes in the UNSG CAC
report; and the “many more” refers to an additional figure of 311 schools hit by
mortar shells and crossfire (43% of Sa’ada schools in 2010 – of which there were
725), without specifying how many of those were targeted and how many were
caught in crossfire. The Secretary-General’s report did not specify a number of
attacks on schools in 2010.

Attacks broadly fall into three categories of situation. The first is where the
perpetrator is not a government and where the government could not reasonably
be expected to have prevented the attack or have been in a position to respond
to the attack (e.g. in a seceded area not under its control, or where there is no
prior pattern of attack and no advance warning); the second is where the perpetrator is not a government but where the government might reasonably have
prevented the attack or should have responded more effectively; and the third is

where the government (understood as including all state forces such as the military and the police, not just the political authority) is the perpetrator and does
not hold itself to account through legal processes.

The first violation for which a party could be listed was recruitment and use of
children by armed forces and armed groups. Subsequent Security Council resolutions added other violations: killing and maiming of children and rape and other
grave sexual violence against children (SC Resolution 1882) and attacks on
schools and hospitals (SC Resolution 1998). Abduction and denial of humanitarian access do not lead to listing, but are monitored in all situations.

The only piece of qualitative evidence assessing an outcome of community
participation identified during the research is given in CARE’s research report on
Afghanistan. This states that 65% of respondents from communities with a
school that was not attacked said the community requested the building of the
school, but slightly fewer (56%) respondents from villages where the school was
attacked said the same. Hence the probability of attack may be somewhat
reduced when communities themselves request or want the school - although a
9% difference is not statistically significant enough to enable broad conclusions.

Save the Children ran and implemented a programme entitled Rewrite the
Future, with the aim of improving education in conflict-affected states. The objectives included increasing access, with one of the possible activities to achieve
increased access being school rehabilitation or construction. See for example:

or reduce future cycles of violence. Save the Children has addressed issues of
discrimination against minorities (such as Hindu and Sikh communities) in
mainstream education in Afghanistan. One school was set up in a Sikh temple,
with a Sikh director and Muslim teachers. This initiative came from a Muslim
child media group, who discovered that children from Hindu and Sikh communities were not attending school. This initiative has implications for widening reli-

Primary steps in the process include: establishing coordination mechanisms;
carrying out community assessments; establishing mechanisms for ongoing
dialogue between various stakeholders; establishing a Code of Conduct for the
Declaration of LIZOP; community skills assessment and capacity strengthening;
awareness-raising; community-level days of celebration and declaration of
peace; and monitoring and advocating for government monitoring and enforcement of legislation – including establishing stronger links with MRM monitoring
mechanisms.

In September 1986, the first Zone of Peace, Freedom, and Neutrality (ZOPFAN)
in the Philippines was declared in Naga City in southern Luzon. This was a
community-based and people-initiated peace effort, involving the council of
elders and the church. Since then, this model has gained ground around the
country. For more details, see: Pushpa Iyer, Peace Zones of Mindanao,

Church groups involved were of various denominations depending on the
community. In communities where more than one religious or church group is
present, the full range of religious groups would ideally be involved in the
process.

Some examples include: In Herat in western Afghanistan, police collaborated
with the community after an attack to arrange meetings to negotiate an end to
attacks and the reopening of schools. Global Education Cluster, Protecting
Education in Countries Affected by Conflict Booklet 3: Community-based
Protection and Prevention (Global Education Cluster, October 2012), 8. In 2010, it
was reported that a school in Jowzjan reopened after local communities put pressure on the Taliban. Elsewhere, the Taliban closed schools for two months as the
government wanted to use them as election stations. The local elders convinced
the government not to conduct election polling in schools and the Taliban to
permit the schools to function. Antonio Giustozzi and Claudio Franco, The Battle

The concept of community schools has been taken to scale by national and

students, according to data given in Morten Sigsgaard, Education and Fragility in
Afghanistan: A Situational Analysis (Paris: UNESCO International Institute for
Educational Planning, 2009), 19. This information illustrates the scope for variation in the level at which communities engage in one specific form of programmatic action. Some villages have initiated community schools themselves, others
have been involved primarily in their implementation.

Current debates are characterized by a lack of consensus over what constitutes an ‘attack’ on higher education communities, versus an infringement of
academic freedom [or of the right to education] that falls short of the meaning of
the term ‘attack’. This has methodological repercussions evident in the difficulty
of establishing an agreed-upon set of indicators for monitoring attacks.

For example, according to Jarecki and Kaisth, in three-quarters of cases of
scholars granted assistance by the Scholar Rescue Fund, the sole or a
contributing source of persecution was the state. Henry Jarecki and Daniela

Brain drain is the process of migration of highly-skilled and educated people
that implies a loss of human capital for the country of origin. Attacks on higher
education may trigger involuntary migration by victims of attacks and those similarly intimidated who seek physical security elsewhere, as well as voluntary
migration by those seeking more favorable, secure and open environments in
which to pursue their academic interests.
307
Henry Jarecki and Daniela Kaisth, Scholar Rescue in the Modern World (New

illustrating a number of consequences such as self-censorship, fear, retreat and
brain drain following the systematic and widespread attacks on academics and
university students. See Dirk Adriaensen, Lieven De Cauter, Ward Treunen,

The Draft Lucens Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from
Military Use during Armed Conflict have tried to address the third challenge in
Guideline 5 by stating that: “[T]he fighting forces of parties to armed conflict
should generally not be employed on security tasks related to schools and
universities except when the risk to those institutions is assessed as high; if
alternative means of reducing the likelihood of attack are not feasible; if evacuation from the high risk area is not feasible; and if there are no alternative appropriately trained civilian personnel available to provide security. (a) If such
fighting forces are engaged in security tasks related to schools and universities,
their presence within the grounds or buildings of the school should be avoided if
at all possible, to avoid compromising its civilian status and disrupting the
learning environment.” GCPEA, Draft Lucens Guidelines for Protecting Schools
and Universities from Military Use During Armed Conflict (New York: GCPEA, 8
July 2013).

326
For example, a 2009 report on human rights violations against Colombian
students, issued jointly by the UK’s National Union of Students, University
College Union and the UK-based NGO Justice for Colombia, concluded that the
Colombian state not only did little to prevent attacks and systematically failed to
capture or punish perpetrators, but also, security forces were found to have been
directly involved in many of the attacks. The report suggests that in such a situation only international pressure and human rights campaigns addressed to the
government can make a real difference. See Colombia: Students in The Firing

access to education and improve the quality of teacher training by promoting

Finnemore and Sikkink note that: “[I]nternational legitimation is important
insofar as it reacts back on a government’s domestic basis of legitimation and
consent and thus ultimately on its ability to stay in power.” This dynamic was
part of the explanation for regime transitions in South Africa, Latin America and
Southern Europe. Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, “International Norm

For example, India’s Supreme Court ordered security forces to clear out of all
schools in Chhattisgarh state but almost half a year later the court noted that
“[T]he State of Chhattisgarh had categorically denied that any schools … were
continuing to be occupied by security forces, and in fact all such facilities had
been vacated. However, during the course of the hearings before this bench it
has turned out that the facts asserted in the earlier affidavit were erroneous, and

As stated in the methodology section, the statistical information on enrolment and literacy rates in profiled countries should be treated with caution,
especially in the case of those countries that have experienced considerable
disruption due to armed conflict, insecurity or instability. Though formally
correct, such statistical data may contain outdated information and may not
capture with full accuracy the actual educational situation of a country.

401
The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) indicates the number of students enrolled in
a particular level of education regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of
the population at the official age for a given level. It is therefore often a much
higher figure than the Net Enrolment Ratio (NER), which represents the
percentage of students enrolled at a particular level who actually belong to the
official age group for that level. This study cites NER whenever possible, but for
some countries and levels of education, GER is the only available figure and has
therefore had to be used instead.

The government implemented a demobilization of paramilitary groups
between 2003 and 2006. Since then, elements of former paramilitary groups and
new groups have continued to use violence, including in relation to drug trafficking and other criminal activities. These are referred to here as paramilitary
successor groups. See HRW, Paramilitaries’ heirs: The new face of violence in
Colombia (New York: HRW, February 2010), 18-36.
