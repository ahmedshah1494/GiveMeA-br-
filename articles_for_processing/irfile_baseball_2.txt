While that may seem like an odd subject for a sports column, it turns out to be surprisingly important, and a topic that ties directly into a larger discussion that is beginning to get a public airing about the number and severity of fan injuries that occur at baseball games. Not to spoil the punch line, but the days when major league teams could avoid liability for fan injuries by inserting some legalistic fine print on the back of the ticket could soon be coming to a close.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="194" data-total-count="748">But back to umbrellas. Specifically to the umbrellas fans were using during the third inning of <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/boxscore.jsp?gid=2011_08_25_oakmlb_nyamlb_1">a game between the Yankees and the Oakland Athletics</a> at Yankee Stadium on Thursday, Aug. 25, 2011.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="553" data-total-count="1301">A 50-year-old Manhattan real estate executive named Andy Zlotnick had gotten his hands on some great seats for that game: he was sitting in the third row, about 50 feet or so past first base, with his 13-year-old son and two of his son\u2019s friends. It was a rainy day, and there had been a 90-minute rain delay. Although it continued to rain intermittently in the early innings, there was no question that Zlotnick was going to stick it out. What parent bails when he\u2019s taken three excited teenagers to a ballgame, no matter how miserable the weather?</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="533" data-total-count="1834">In truth, the weather was bad enough that the game might have been postponed earlier in the season. But by late August, the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/sports/baseball/majorleague/newyorkyankees/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="Recent news and scores about the New York Yankees.">Yankees</a>, a veteran team in the playoff hunt, had only two days off remaining on their schedule. Hurricane Irene was roaring up the East Coast; there was concern that other games might have to be postponed over the weekend. \u201cIf this game gets rained out it\u2019s gonna cause many, many logistical problems,\u201d an announcer said during the rain delay. \u201cThis is a game both teams desperately wanted to play.\u201d</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="603" data-total-count="2437" id="story-continues-1">By the top of the third inning, the rain was coming down hard again. As he stepped into the batter\u2019s box, Hideki Matsui, then playing for the A\u2019s, wiped the bill of his batting helmet with his sleeve to remove the accumulated water. Zlotnick, surrounded by open umbrellas, couldn\u2019t see Matsui or Phil Hughes, the <a class="meta-org" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/sports/baseball/majorleague/newyorkyankees/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="Recent news and scores about the New York Yankees.">Yankees</a>\u2019 pitcher. Thus when Matsui pulled a scorching foul ball down the first-base side, Zlotnick never had a chance. A second \u2014 literally \u2014 after he heard the crack of the bat, he was on the ground, howling in agony, blood streaming from his eye and the left side of his face.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="635" data-total-count="3072" id="story-continues-3">Matsui\u2019s line drive foul completely destroyed the bones around Zlotnick\u2019s left eye socket, fractured his sinus and upper jaw, and did extensive damage to the left side of his face. Zlotnick now believes that his titanium glasses, which crumpled but didn\u2019t break, may have saved his life. His plastic surgeon, Henry Spinelli, who operated on him six days later, told me that his injuries were akin to someone being punched in the eye with brass knuckles. After Matsui hit the ball, one of the announcers, noticing a leopard-print umbrella down the first-base line, said, \u201cI think that leopard one has an extra big spot on it.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="738" data-total-count="3810">Zlotnick is a thoughtful, methodical \u2014 and very persistent \u2014 man. During his slow recovery, he began to research the umbrella policies for the 30 major league teams. He discovered that while eight teams forbade the use of umbrellas except during rain delays \u2014 two didn\u2019t even allow them in the ballpark \u2014 many other teams had policies like the Yankees\u2019, which simply said that umbrellas were permitted, \u201cso long as they do not interfere with other Guests\u2019 enjoyment of the game or event.\u201d No mention of safety, you\u2019ll notice. More broadly, Zlotnick began investigating the numerous \u2014 and they are indeed numerous \u2014 injuries sustained by fans at major league ballparks because of hard-hit foul balls or broken bats.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="484" data-total-count="4294">He also reached out to Randy Levine, the Yankees\u2019 president. They met in November 2011. Zlotnick showed him pictures of his injury, including a gruesome selfie he took in the emergency room. He explained to Levine that some teams didn\u2019t allow open umbrellas during play because of the danger they posed. \u201cI said, \u2018I would like the Yankees to do the right thing,\u2019 \u201d Zlotnick recalled. \u201cPlease ask your owners to prohibit umbrellas so no one will suffer the way I have.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="4382">(The Yankees declined to offer their version of Zlotnick\u2019s conversations with Levine.)</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="4605">He also told Levine that of the $100,000-plus he had racked up in medical bills, he\u2019d had to pay about $25,000 out of pocket. He asked that the Yankees reimburse him. Levine said: \u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="327" data-total-count="4932">By early 2012, not having heard anything, Zlotnick called Levine. This time, Levine told him he had to check with \u201cthe insurance folks\u201d about the reimbursement. A week after that, Levine told Zlotnick \u2014 again according to Zlotnick \u2014 \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything for you, and my lawyers have told me not to speak to you.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="362" data-total-count="5294">Near the end of 2012, feeling he had been left with no choice, Zlotnick filed a personal-injury lawsuit against the Yankees and Major League Baseball. It was not about the $25,000, which Zlotnick had the means to cover. His main goal, he told me, was to force the Yankees to change their umbrella policy \u2014 and for M.L.B. to start taking fan injuries seriously.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="147" data-total-count="5441">Thanks largely to that fine print I mentioned earlier, it is nearly impossible for an injured fan to win a lawsuit against the Yankees or the Mets.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="628" data-total-count="6069" id="story-continues-4">\u201cThe bearer of the ticket assumes all risk and danger incidental to the sport of baseball,\u201d <a href="http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/components/ticketing/postseason/popup_termsconditions.jsp" title="The Yankees\u2019 ticket policy.">the Yankees declare</a> on the back on their tickets. The legal boilerplate then goes on to disclaim all liability if a fan is injured at Yankee Stadium. Zlotnick\u2019s lawyer, Edward Steinberg, told me that New York courts had been \u201ctough\u201d in enforcing what\u2019s known as the \u201cassumption of risk\u201d doctrine. (Some people call it the \u201cbaseball rule.\u201d) Indeed, Steinberg, who is a personal-injury lawyer, said that he routinely turns away badly injured fans who want to sue, because the suits have so little chance of succeeding.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="187" data-total-count="6256">But he viewed Zlotnick\u2019s case differently. In allowing open umbrellas during the game, the Yankees, in his legal opinion, negligently increased the danger posed by the game of baseball.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="353" data-total-count="6609">In July 2013, Lizbeth Gonzalez, a State Supreme Court judge in the Bronx, set a deposition schedule, allowing each side to question witnesses under oath. Four months after taking Zlotnick\u2019s deposition in February 2014 \u2014 but before Steinberg could depose any Yankees witnesses \u2014 the Yankees\u2019 lawyers raced to court and filed for summary judgment.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="6807">Arguing that the assumption of risk doctrine was legally binding in this case \u2014 all those open umbrellas notwithstanding \u2014 the Yankees and M.L.B. argued that the court should throw out the case.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="6986">Today, nearly a year and a half later, the two sides are still awaiting Gonzalez\u2019s ruling. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/nyregion/justice-denied-bronx-court-system-mired-in-delays.html">As The New York Times noted</a> in 2013, the courts are a little backed up in the Bronx.)</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="19" data-total-count="7005"><strong>A Common Occurrence</strong></p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="665" data-total-count="7670">In September 2014, a Bloomberg News reporter named David Glovin <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-09/baseball-caught-looking-as-fouls-injure-1-750-fans-a-year">wrote an article</a> about the extent of the injuries sustained by fans during baseball games. What made the story especially noteworthy was that it was based on a statistical analysis done by Bloomberg \u2014 the first ever, according to Glovin \u2014 of the number of people who get hurt during games, primarily from foul balls and broken bats. The number Bloomberg came up with, confirmed by five mathematicians and statisticians who reviewed the analysis, was astounding: about 1,750 a year. As Glovin noted, \u201cThat\u2019s more often than a batter is hit by a pitch, which happened 1,536 times last season.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="7989">Not every fan gets hurt as badly as Zlotnick, of course, but there are plenty who do. Glovin noted the 6-year-old girl who \u201cunderwent surgery in 2010 after the ball shattered her skull\u201d during an Atlanta Braves game, and the 7-year-old in Chicago who \u201csustained severe brain swelling from a foul liner in 2008.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="287" data-total-count="8276">Zlotnick pointed me to the case of Laura Turek, a single mother who sustained a concussion, multiple fractures and extensive eye damage after being hit by a foul ball last season during a game between the Milwaukee Brewers and the Braves \u2014 and whose medical bills have topped $200,000.</p>, <p class="summary">Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.</p>, <p class="error captcha-error hidden">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>, <p class="error invalid-email-error hidden">Invalid email address.

Carpenter\u2019s injury received national publicity.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="8678" id="story-continues-5">Although the sheer number of injuries may be surprising to fans, it is not surprising to those who make their living coaching or playing baseball.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="95" data-total-count="8773">\u201cSometimes we cringe: Somebody just got smoked,\u201d Braves Manager Fredi Gonzalez told Glovin.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="123" data-total-count="8896">The former outfielder Matt Stairs once told The Chicago Tribune that he won\u2019t allow his daughters to sit near the dugout.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="111" data-total-count="9007">Many other players have the same rule: Because they see it every game, they know how dangerous those seats are.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="255" data-total-count="9262">Indeed, during the last several contract negotiations, the Major League Players Association has tried to negotiate for fan safety, arguing that baseball teams should extend the netting behind home plate down the two foul lines. That argument went nowhere.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="499" data-total-count="9761">What has been baseball\u2019s big objection to extending protective netting? Mainly, that it would detract from the fans\u2019 enjoyment of the game by erecting a barrier between the fans in those valuable, up-close seats. Baseball has long denied that there is a problem that needs to be dealt with. \u201cThere is no epidemic of foul ball damage yet that would warrant some sort of edict or action by the commissioner\u2019s office,\u201d John McHale told Glovin. McHale is a top Major League Baseball executive.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="23" data-total-count="9784"><strong>Class-Action Suit Filed</strong></p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="459" data-total-count="10243">Bob Gorman, the author of the book <a href="http://www.deathattheballpark.com/">\u201cDeath At the Ballpark\u201d</a> who blogs about fan injuries, said, \u201cIt seems like it is going to take someone to die before they do anything about it.\u201d He pointed out that in March 2002, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Brittanie_Cecil">a young girl died</a> after being hit by a puck during an N.H.L. game in Columbus, Ohio. It took all of three months for the N.H.L. to mandate the installation of \u201chigh-quality protective netting at the ends and corners of their rinks.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="10663">In mid-July, two prominent plaintiffs\u2019 firms filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of all season-ticket holders against Major League Baseball and Commissioner Rob Manfred. According to <a href="http://www.hbsslaw.com/cases-and-investigations/cases/Major-League-Baseball-Season-Ticket-Holders">a news release</a> issued by the plaintiffs, Manfred is alleged to have \u201cfailed to uphold his duties to enact safety measures against the danger of foul balls and broken bats through a pattern of negligence, misrepresentation,\u201d etc.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="520" data-total-count="11183" id="story-continues-6">Bob Hilliard, one of the lawyers bringing the suit, told me that he believes that the assumption of risk doctrine should no longer protect baseball. The players are bigger and stronger; the seats in newer ballparks are often closer to the foul lines; and the distractions, many of them instigated by teams to keep fans engaged, are plentiful. Even fans who are paying attention can\u2019t necessarily get out of the way of a hard-hit foul ball. \u201cYou can\u2019t assume risk that you can\u2019t protect against,\u201d Hilliard said.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="266" data-total-count="11449">Perhaps it is just a coincidence, but on Thursday, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/sports/baseball/mlb-roundup.html" title="A Times article.">Manfred\u2019s office said</a> that it would \u201cannounce shortly a recommendation regarding netting for the 2016 season\u201d\u2014 details of which will be revealed after the January owners\u2019 meeting, according to a spokesman.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="427" data-total-count="11876">As for Zlotnick, although he looks fine today, he\u2019s not. He feels pain whenever anyone touches the left side of his face, has blurry vision and has numbness in his mouth. His wife, Jeanne Lutfy, told me that she can\u2019t even kiss him on the left side without inflicting some pain. The injury has changed him, too, she said. \u201cHe lost a certain lightness to his personality, as if the ball knocked it out of him,\u201d she said.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="398" data-total-count="12274">And the Yankees? The team\u2019s position is that it goes out of its way to warn fans about the potential dangers and the importance of paying attention to what\u2019s happening on the field. It also notes that fans who fear for their safety are welcome to request a different seat. The Yankees believe, despite the open umbrellas on Aug. 25, 2011, they have no legal liability for Zlotnick\u2019s injuries.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="467" data-total-count="12741">After the 2011 season, however, the Yankees did change their umbrella policy. Although fans can still bring umbrellas into the ballpark \u2014 and can still use them while a game is in progress \u2014 the Yankees no longer permit oversized umbrellas, nor do they want open umbrellas to \u201ccompromise other Guests\u2019 ability to view the game.\u201d According to the current policy, fans \u201cmay be asked to close their umbrellas if it is obstructing the view of other Guests.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="12959">Baseball likes to say that it puts fan safety first. When baseball mandates netting down the foul lines, and a leaguewide policy that bans open umbrellas while a game is being played, I\u2019ll believe it.
