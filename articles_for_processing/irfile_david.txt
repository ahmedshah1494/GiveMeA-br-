Plenty of people did that last week when his album <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/arts/music/review-blackstar-david-bowies-emotive-and-cryptic-new-album.html">\u201cBlackstar\u201d</a> appeared. There he was, singing about transformation and absence <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/arts/music/on-david-bowies-blackstar-turning-to-jazz-for-inspiration.html">over a bed of jazz</a>. He hadn\u2019t gone anywhere.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="235" data-total-count="771">When <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/arts/music/david-bowie-dies-at-69.html">he died two days later</a>, the record sounded very different. An artist who dealt in theatrical illusion and metaphor seemed to be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/arts/music/david-bowie-allowed-his-art-to-deliver-a-final-message.html">sending a DM about his own coming death</a>, a message that would only arrive when he was physically gone.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="305" data-total-count="1076">(Since Sunday, there has also been a growing awareness of an Elvis Presley track called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Jkv1cs6PE">\u201cBlack Star\u201d</a> \u2014 it was the discarded first version of a 1960 movie theme song later called \u201cFlaming Star\u201d \u2014 in which Presley sang: \u201cWhen a man sees his black star/he knows his time, his time has come.\u201d)</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="1372">But the first reaction wasn\u2019t wrong. \u201cBlackstar\u201d does take up themes that Bowie had been working on at least since \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d in 1969. Death \u2014 and exile, and between-ness, and alienation and erasure \u2014 was one. According to Simon Critchley, our guest this week, love was another.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="558" data-total-count="1930">Mr. Critchley, philosopher, author and the Hans Jonas Professor at the New School for Social Research in New York, is also the moderator of <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/the-stone/">The Stone</a>, the philosophy series on The New York Times\u2019s Opinionator blog. He published <a href="http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/bowie/">the book-length meditation \u201cBowie\u201d</a> in 2014, and <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/nothing-remains-david-bowies-vision-of-love/">wrote an essay</a> for the Stone this week proposing that to see darkness and hopelessness in Bowie\u2019s songs is to miss the point. \u201cAt the core of Bowie\u2019s music and his apparent negativity,\u201d he writes, \u201cis a profound yearning for connection and, most of all, for love.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="2218">\u201cWhat Bowie, for me, did,\u201d Mr. Critchley said during our conversation, \u201cwas to depict a world that had completely disintegrated, a world that had dissolved, that had become nothing. And in that world, that had become nothing, to dredge from that the kind of nothing that is love.\u201d</p>, <p class="feedback-message">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>, <p class="user-action"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/popcast-pop-music-podcast">See More \xbb</a></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Access to NYTimes.com and all NYTimes apps</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Unlimited article access, anytime, anywhere</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Times Insider Access, including behind-the-scenes stories, exclusive events, podcasts, and e-books</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">1 complimentary digital subscription to give anyone you'd like</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Customized delivery options such as Sunday only, Fri.-Sun., weekday delivery, or daily delivery</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">The weekly Sunday magazine and monthly T Magazine</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">2 complimentary digital subscriptions to give anyone you'd like</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="user-action"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">Go to Home Page \xbb</a></p>]
