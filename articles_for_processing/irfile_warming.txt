Sea levels are also rising as ocean temperatures warm, leading to higher chances of inundation and coastal flooding. Oceans absorb large amounts of the world\u2019s excess heat.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="873">Extreme weather events are increasingly common, said Steve Rintoul, interim director of Australia\u2019s climate science center at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and an author of the report. And that trend will continue.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="189" data-total-count="1062">\u201cAlthough a 1-degree-Celsius rise in air temperatures seems small, it is enough to shift base-line averages,\u201d Dr. Rintoul said, referring to an increase equal to 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="63" data-total-count="1125">He added, \u201cIt increases the odds those events will happen.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="297" data-total-count="1422">The biennial report, by scientists at Csiro and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, draws on data collected at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/world/australia/climate-change-research-csiro.html">Cape Grim, Tasmania</a>, where greenhouse gases caught in the atmosphere are measured, and from a program called Argo that tracks temperatures and other conditions in the world\u2019s oceans.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="215" data-total-count="1637" id="story-continues-1">Australia is viewed as a leading example of a developed country being hit hard by <a class="meta-classifier" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival news about global warming.">climate change</a>, and the report hints at the complex effects the rest of the world may face as climate change alters weather patterns.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="1929">\u201cThe whole globe is subject to change,\u201d said Karl Braganza, of the Bureau of Meteorology, another author of the report. \u201cIt is sobering to look at other countries, countries like Bangladesh, or African nations, where their ability to deal with drought is much more reduced than ours.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="628" data-total-count="2557">Up to 75 percent of ocean warming occurred in the Southern Hemisphere, the report said. As oceans absorb carbon dioxide and water temperatures increase, they expand, contributing to a rise in sea levels. Warmer oceans have also prompted a shift in large-scale weather patterns, which in turn affects rainfall. Although precipitation across Australia varies year to year, Csiro said the recent drying out of southern Australia was the strongest recorded large-scale change in rainfall since national records began in 1900. Years with lower-than-average growing-season rain would be more frequent in some regions, the report said.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="352" data-total-count="2909">Rainfall in the southwest reached such lows that Perth, the capital of Western Australia, mostly relied on water from <a class="meta-classifier" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/desalination/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about desalination.">desalination</a> plants, Dr. Rintoul said. Long-term averages have declined 19 percent since 1970, but that has accelerated to 25 percent since 1996. Perth, an isolated city on the far western coast, has a population of about two million.</p>, <p class="summary"></p>, <p class="error captcha-error hidden">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>, <p class="error invalid-email-error hidden">Invalid email address.

In the food-growing Murray-Darling Basin, in southern New South Wales and Victoria, stream flows were 41 percent lower than average, and in some parts of Victoria, they declined more than 70 percent.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="3503">The report also said that since 1993, sea levels to the north, west and southeast of Australia surpassed the global average. Ocean warming contributed to about a third of that rise, of about 20 centimeters, or 7.8 inches, since the late 1800s. The remainder was attributed to melting sea ice and changes to water stored on land.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="3774">The scientists, who said carbon dioxide emissions were largely because of the burning of fossil fuels like coal, refrained from urging the government to increase its commitment to lowering pollution targets. Australia has yet to ratify the Paris accord on climate change.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="4008">In August 2015, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/world/asia/australia-sets-emissions-goal-but-climate-scientists-say-it-falls-short.html">Australia agreed to </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/world/asia/australia-sets-emissions-goal-but-climate-scientists-say-it-falls-short.html">an emissions cut</a> of between 26 and 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. But state authorities have pushed ahead with plans for an immense coal mine in Queensland, inland from the Great Barrier Reef.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="641" data-total-count="4649">For almost a decade, Australia has fought bitterly over efforts to curb polluters. Two years ago, the country repealed carbon laws requiring large companies to pay for greenhouse gas emissions, a measure intended to penalize hundreds of its biggest producers of carbon emissions. During his successful campaign for prime minister a year earlier, Tony Abbott, then the leader of the Liberal Party, said the tax pushed up electricity prices for consumers. That claim contributed to his party\u2019s win. The emission targets that he put in place, derided as too low by environmental groups, remain in effect under his successor, Malcolm Turnbull.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="353" data-total-count="5002">Dr. Rintoul said historical emissions meant temperatures in Australia would continue to rise. Temperatures in the spring hit highs for three consecutive years starting in 2013, he noted. And agreements reached in Paris would not limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, he said, adding that carbon emissions were at peak levels in 2015 and would rise.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="37" data-total-count="5039" id="story-continues-2">\u201cWe have to go further,\u201d he said.</p>, <p><i>Follow Michelle Innis on Twitter </i><a href="https://twitter.com/MichelleInnis"><i>@MichelleInnis</i></a><i>. </i></p>, <p class="feedback-message">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Access to NYTimes.com and all NYTimes apps</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Unlimited article access, anytime, anywhere</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Times Insider Access, including behind-the-scenes stories, exclusive events, podcasts, and e-books</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">1 complimentary digital subscription to give anyone you'd like</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Customized delivery options such as Sunday only, Fri.-Sun., weekday delivery, or daily delivery</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">The weekly Sunday magazine and monthly T Magazine</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">2 complimentary digital subscriptions to give anyone you'd like</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="user-action"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">Go to Home Page \xbb</a></p>]
