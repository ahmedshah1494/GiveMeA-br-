Some of the 1,100 students at the school were lined up and slaughtered with shots to the head. Others were gunned down as they cowered under their desks, or forced to watch as their teachers were riddled with bullets.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="986">Their parents crowded around the school gates, praying their children would survive while listening to the explosions and gunfire as Pakistani commandos stormed the building.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="367" data-total-count="1353">With its chilling echoes of a school in Beslan, Russia, where 186 children <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/04/international/europe/04russia.html" title="A Times article about the Beslan massacre.">were massacred in 2004</a>, the terrorist attack in Peshawar traumatized a scarred city that has suffered intense Taliban violence since the insurgency erupted seven years ago. By evening, mosques were filled with mourners carrying small wooden coffins, and residents cried openly in the streets.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="389" data-total-count="1742">A Taliban spokesman said the attack had been retaliation for the continuing military operation against the group in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/world/asia/Waziristan-Region-of-Pakistan-Has-Long-History-of-Rebellion.html">North Waziristan</a> tribal region. But the image of children\u2019s bodies on the floor of their school auditorium, some of them not yet in their teens, again demonstrated how the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/world/asia/how-the-pakistani-taliban-became-a-deadly-force.html" title="A Times article about the insurgency.">Pakistani Taliban\u2019s war</a> has often been taken out on the country\u2019s most vulnerable citizens.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="116" data-total-count="1858">A wave of outrage crossed national boundaries, with statements of support and sympathy coming from around the world.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="315" data-total-count="2173">Even other militant groups felt obliged to comment, though perhaps cynically. A spokesman for the Afghan Taliban, who have pushed civilian casualties in Afghanistan to a new high in the past year, posted a Twitter message criticizing the attack as un-Islamic and expressing shared pain with the victims\u2019 families.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="426" data-total-count="2599">Witnesses in Peshawar said the assault started around 10 a.m., when nine heavily armed militants, disguised in paramilitary uniforms, slipped through a military graveyard and leapt over the back wall of the Army Public School. They rushed through the main building, shooting and flinging grenades before reaching the auditorium. There, according to one Pakistani official, a senior army official was giving a first aid course.</p>, <p class="summary">The Pakistani Taliban\u2019s attack on a school in Peshawar in December signaled a significant change of tactics.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="2880">First they sprayed the students with bullets; then they singled out the survivors. \u201cOur instructor asked us to duck and lie down,\u201d a student named Zeeshan said in an interview at the hospital. \u201cThen I saw militants walking past rows of students, shooting them in the head.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="3244">Elsewhere in the school, teachers, realizing what was going on, abruptly canceled classes and exams and tried to protect their charges, who ranged in age from roughly 5 to 17. A 7-year-old named Afaq broke down as he described how the militants sprayed bullets as they rushed into his classroom. \u201cThey killed our teacher,\u201d he said, his eyes welling with tears.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="357" data-total-count="3601">Although early assessments suggested that the gunmen had been intent on mounting a long siege \u2014 some were carrying stores of food, it was later discovered \u2014 a senior security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, insisted that they had shown no intention of taking hostages. \u201cThey were there to kill, and this is what they did,\u201d he said.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="352" data-total-count="3953">The school turned into a battleground when commandos from the army\u2019s elite Special Services Group moved in. As the battle for control spread across the school, cornered militants detonated their suicide vests, causing loud blasts that rang across the city. Some attackers appeared to be speaking in Arabic, others in Pashto, survivors later reported.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="4172">Some students managed to flee, running from the school in their uniforms of green sweaters and blazers. Desperate relatives rushed to local hospitals or gathered outside the school gates, seeking news of their children.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="148" data-total-count="4320">One man, Muhammad Arshad, sighed with relief after soldiers rescued his son Ehsan. \u201cI am thankful to God for giving him a second life,\u201d he said.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="125" data-total-count="4445">Others never made it.

But even that success has come with caveats. The fighting sent more than a million civilians fleeing in a country already awash with internally displaced people. And many militant cells are reported to have merely moved to neighboring districts, or on the other side of the border with Afghanistan.</p>, <p class="interactive-summary">\n                Maps of the major attacks since June.            </p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="5703">It offered some relief to citizens that the Pakistani Taliban had, for the most part, failed to deliver the revenge they had threatened when the military offensive began in June.
