Humanitarian agencies, which were geared mainly to deal with crises on a country-by-country basis, are increasingly being asked to respond to the wider regional impact of conflicts.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="235" data-total-count="1648">Nearly one-third of Unicef\u2019s 2015 appeal is for Syria, where 5.6 million children have been caught up in the civil war. \u201cAn entire generation of children are in danger of understanding violence as a normal way of life,\u201d Ms. Khan.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="1932">The agency has helped rehabilitate schools in areas controlled by the government and providing learning materials to areas under the control of opposition armed groups.
