She wakes her at 5:30 a.m. to study math and Chinese poetry and packs her schedule so tightly that she has only 20 days of summer vacation.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="331" data-total-count="638">So when officials announced a plan to admit more students from impoverished regions and fewer from Nanjing to local universities, Ms. Cheng was furious. She joined more than 1,000 parents to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pilC1EqIMHM" title="Video">protest outside government offices</a>, chanting slogans like \u201cFairness in education!\u201d and demanding a meeting with the provincial governor.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="799">\u201cWhy should they eat from our bowls?\u201d Ms. Cheng, 46, an art editor at a newspaper, said in an interview. \u201cWe are just as hard-working as other families.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="355" data-total-count="1154">Parents in at least two dozen Chinese cities have taken to the streets in recent weeks to denounce a government effort to expand access to higher education for students from less developed regions. The unusually fierce backlash is testing the Communist Party\u2019s ability to manage class conflict, as well as the political acumen of its leader, Xi Jinping.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="245" data-total-count="1399" id="story-continues-2">The nation\u2019s cutthroat university admissions process has long been a source of anxiety and acrimony. But the breadth and intensity of the demonstrations, many of them organized on social media, appear to have taken the authorities by surprise.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="210" data-total-count="1609" id="story-continues-3">At issue is China\u2019s state-run system of higher education, in which top schools are concentrated in big prosperous cities, mostly on the coast, and weaker, underfunded schools dominate the nation\u2019s interior.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="1950">Placement is determined almost exclusively by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/magazine/inside-a-chinese-test-prep-factory.html">a single national exam, the gaokao</a>, which was administered across China starting on Tuesday. The test is considered so important to one\u2019s fate that many parents begin preparing their children for it before kindergarten. The government has threatened to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/world/asia/china-exam-gaokao-university-cheating.html">imprison</a> cheaters for up to seven years.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="266" data-total-count="2216">The exam gives the admissions system a meritocratic sheen, but the government also reserves most spaces in universities for students in the same city or province, in effect making it harder for applicants from the hinterlands to get into the nation\u2019s best schools.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="239" data-total-count="2455">The authorities have sought to address the problem in recent years by admitting more students from underrepresented regions to the top colleges. Some provinces also award extra points on the test to students representing ethnic minorities.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="287" data-total-count="2742">This spring, the Ministry of Education announced that it would set aside a record 140,000 spaces \u2014 about 6.5 percent of spots in the top schools \u2014 for students from less developed provinces. But the ministry said it would force the schools to admit fewer local students to make room.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="107" data-total-count="2849">Against the backdrop of slowing economic growth, the plan set off a flurry of protests and counterprotests.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="263" data-total-count="3112">In Wuhan, a major city in central China known for its good universities, parents surrounded government offices to demand more spots for local students. In Harbin, a northeastern city, parents marched through the streets, calling the new admissions mandate unjust.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="3425">But in Luoyang, a city in Henan Province, one of China\u2019s poorest and most populous, protesters countered that children should be treated with \u201cequal love.\u201d And in Baoding, a few hours\u2019 drive southwest of Beijing, parents accused the government of coddling the urban elite at the expense of rural students.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="3623" id="story-continues-4">\u201cWhen they need water, land and crops, they come and take it,\u201d said Lu Jian, 42, an electrician who participated in the protests in Baoding. \u201cBut they won\u2019t let our kids study in Beijing.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="132" data-total-count="3755">The government has responded cautiously, censoring news reports of the outcry and ordering the police to contain the demonstrations.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="233" data-total-count="3988">Analysts said the protests posed a delicate challenge for President Xi, whose signature slogan, the \u201cChina dream,\u201d is a vaguely defined call for national rejuvenation that many associate with a promise of educational opportunity.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="4321">\u201cThe traditional Chinese dream is the hope of advancement for children through a relatively open, meritocratic and egalitarian system,\u201d said Carl F. Minzner, a professor of law at Fordham University and an expert on Chinese government. \u201cPopular outrage is triggered when there\u2019s a perception that this is being challenged.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="327" data-total-count="4648">Mr. Xi has argued that high levels of inequality in China could shake the party\u2019s hold on power, and his government has sought to ease frustration in poorer areas by investing in education, health care and social services. But party leaders are also wary of alienating a growing and increasingly outspoken urban middle class.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="171" data-total-count="4819">\u201cThe question is how far are they willing to go in reallocating the privileges enjoyed by established urbanites, many of them state employees,\u201d Professor Minzner said.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="5075">Over the past two decades, the government has opened hundreds of new institutions of higher education, and university enrollment surged to 26.2 million in 2015 from 3.4 million in 1998, though much of the growth has been in three-year polytechnic programs.</p>, <p class="summary">Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the Asian morning.</p>, <p class="error captcha-error hidden">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>, <p class="error invalid-email-error hidden">Invalid email address.

That has left parents worried about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/business/in-china-families-bet-it-all-on-a-child-in-college.html">wasting their life savings</a> on substandard schools and even more desperate to get their children into the better ones.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="5671" id="story-continues-5">Dissatisfaction with the gaokao (pronounced GOW-kow) is also rising. The test, modeled after China\u2019s old imperial civil service exam, was intended to enhance social mobility and open up the universities to anyone who scored high enough. But critics say the system now has the opposite effect, reinforcing the divide between urban and rural students.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="441" data-total-count="6112">The top universities in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing are the most likely to lead to jobs and the hardest to get into. Students from less developed regions are vastly underrepresented at these colleges. That is because they attended schools with less money for good teachers or modern technology and because the admissions preference for local applicants means they often need higher scores on the gaokao than urban students.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="290" data-total-count="6402">\u201cIt is a system that benefits the privileged at the expense of the disadvantaged,\u201d Sida Liu, a sociologist at the University of Toronto, wrote in an email. \u201cWithout the improvement of schools in these regions, I would not expect any major change in educational inequality in China.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="233" data-total-count="6635">The government\u2019s plan to address inequality by taking university spots away from local students, though, tapped into frustration among parents in China\u2019s most modern cities who are unhappy with a shortage of high-quality schools.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="6863">Xiong Bingqi, vice president of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing, described the backlash as \u201can outburst of a long-repressed grudge,\u201d adding that a drastic overhaul of the system should be considered.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="7113">A set of national universities could rely on the gaokao to admit students from across the country, he suggested, while provincial colleges could focus on recruiting local students so they would look more like public universities in the United States.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="315" data-total-count="7428">But any change is likely to draw criticism, given limited resources and ethnic and regional prejudices. A common complaint, for example, is that students from Xinjiang, the far western region that is home to China\u2019s Muslim ethnic Uighur population, receive a subpar education and should not get extra exam points.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="7753">A group of parents in Beijing has filed a complaint with the education ministry contending that minority students at an elite high school who had been recruited from across China should not be treated as residents of the city, and that, instead, spaces should be freed up in Beijing\u2019s universities for other local children.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="7951">In poorer provinces like Henan, public anger is often directed at local governments for underinvesting in education and therefore dooming children in a society with a wide gap between rich and poor.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="8156" id="story-continues-6">\u201cWhen students from Beijing get into top universities and our students fail to do so, some become migrant workers,\u201d said an open letter circulated by parents in Henan last month. \u201cWho is to blame?\u201d</p>, <p><i>Follow Javier C.
