But keeping a pup cool during a heat wave is not.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="461">Julius Pearson, 32, risks his street cred to keep his 6-year-old Pomeranian, Bam Bam, from sizzling. He keeps a spray bottle holstered in his pants when he walks the dog in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where both grew up, and stops every few blocks to mist Bam Bam\u2019s tiny pointed face.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="175" data-total-count="636">\u201cI don\u2019t care what people say,\u201d Mr. Pearson, who works in a hardware store, said over the weekend when temperatures had blistered into the 90s. \u201cMy dog comes first.\u201d</p>, <p class="dogpix-p">Last week, The New York Times asked readers to show us how their dogs were keeping cool in the summer heat, and readers responded by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/20/nyregion/20new-york-summer-dogs.html">sending in photos</a> or posting them to Instagram using the hashtag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/nytdogdays/">#NYTdogdays</a>.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="543" data-total-count="1179">The squished faces of the two Boston terriers owned by Megan Bell and her wife, Bethany Haynes, of Greenwich Village, are the problem in these climes. Their breaths start to make a clicking noise when they overheat, said Ms. Bell, 37, and one, Dizzy, will succumb soon after, splaying in any smidge of cool shadow cast over the sidewalk. Out comes Ms. Bell\u2019s bottled water, and the doggies are flipped over for a reviving douse of water on their bellies. \u201cThey shake it off,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are super offended that I would do that.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="395" data-total-count="1574">At Malibu Dog Kitchen, a dog food specialty store in the West Village, Ashley Brooks, the operations manager, said: In the heat, pay special attention to dog feet. The hot sidewalk, she said, \u201cscalds their little paws.\u201d Her two Chihuahuas wear teeny shoes in this weather. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said, before suggesting that pet owners make goat-milk Popsicles to cool down their dogs.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="194" data-total-count="1768">The schnauzer Buca, 9, who lives in the neighborhood, gets by on frozen watermelon. \u201cWe keep the watermelon people in business,\u201d said Martin Schneider, 56, who works in the airline industry.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="436" data-total-count="2204" id="story-continues-1">But Liz Gonzalez\u2019s dog Nyla, a year-old Border collie-terrier mix, does well with just fresh water, which on Sunday she was drinking from a coffee cup while she watched her owner coach basketball on West Fourth Street. Ms. Gonzalez, from Mount Vernon, N.Y., found Nyla wandering a beach in Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. \u201cIt was 90 degrees,\u201d Ms. Gonzalez said, explaining the dog\u2019s grit. \u201cShe was born in the heat.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-print-citation">A version of this article appears in print on July 25, 2016, on Page A19 of the <span itemprop="printEdition">New York edition</span> with the headline: Keeping Dogs Cool in a Hot City. <span class="story-footer-links"> <span><a href="http://www.nytreprints.com/" target="_blank">Order Reprints</a><span class="pipe">|</span></span> <span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html" target="_blank">Today's Paper</a><span class="pipe">|</span></span><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY" target="_blank">Subscribe</a></span>\n</span>\n</p>, <p class="feedback-message">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Access to NYTimes.com and all NYTimes apps</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Unlimited article access, anytime, anywhere</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Times Insider Access, including behind-the-scenes stories, exclusive events, podcasts, and e-books</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">1 complimentary digital subscription to give anyone you'd like</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Customized delivery options such as Sunday only, Fri.-Sun., weekday delivery, or daily delivery</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">The weekly Sunday magazine and monthly T Magazine</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">2 complimentary digital subscriptions to give anyone you'd like</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="user-action"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">Go to Home Page \xbb</a></p>]
