But the spell of oppressive heat that the weather people spoke of with such alarm \u2014 and with such an ominous-sounding name \u2014 is officially over in New York City. After the skies clear, Friday\u2019s high is expected to be a <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.77657244207131&amp;lon=-73.96940231323242#.V5qps6Kzl03">mere 80 degrees</a>, and the weekend will be balmy.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="19" data-total-count="374">Smile. Wipe a brow.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="183" data-total-count="557">As for the dome, it\u2019s taking a long walk off a short pier. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pushed out into the Atlantic,\u201d Jay Engle, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="43" data-total-count="600">So, how hot did it get under there, anyway?</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="265" data-total-count="865">Pretty hot. Days were in the low to mid-90s, but felt more like the low 100s with the humidity. Nearly 1.5 million people visited the city\u2019s eight beaches. The Hudson River was warmed, on the hottest day, to 79.7 degrees, roughly the temperature of a heated pool.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="1071">The hottest point was Saturday at 2:56 p.m., when temperatures reached 96 degrees in Central Park and 99 at La Guardia Airport, nearly breaking the record temperature for that day, 100 degrees, set in 1955.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="202" data-total-count="1273">During that scorching Saturday, the city received 459 complaints of illegally opened hydrants, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. The city\u2019s 55 outdoor pools were kept open late.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="157" data-total-count="1430">Nearly 3,500 people leapt into the Hudson on Sunday, when, granted, the river was a few degrees cooler than the air: The high was 94 degrees in Central Park.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="285" data-total-count="1715">Virtually all the leapers were participating in the New York City Triathlon, which shortened the running portion of the course because of the heat. Another swimmer was a <a href="http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2016/07/hoboken_man_rescued_from_hudson_river_after_jumpin.html">man in Hoboken, N.J.,</a> whom witnesses saw \u201cdrink a beer, place his belongings in a pile, and jump in the river.\u201d</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="1737" id="story-continues-1">He received a summons.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="236" data-total-count="1973">Crime typically goes up in the heat (and down when it rains). Yet, under the dome, the crime rate dropped citywide. From Friday to Wednesday, crime fell 12.2 percent compared with the same period last year. Murder was down 22.2 percent.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="2207">Still, in the first four days of the heat spell, <a href="http://crimefeed.com/2016/07/4-bodies-found-4-different-nyc-parks-discovered-since-thursday/">four corpses were found in city parks</a>. Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, said, \u201cThe cause and manner of death are still under investigation.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="2438">After the weekend, it went from \u201cdry and hot\u201d to \u201c<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=OKX&amp;product=RWS&amp;format=CI&amp;version=16&amp;glossary=0">hot and humid</a>.\u201d On Monday afternoon a big storm hit, flooding streets. Lightning <a href="https://twitter.com/moltke/status/757690837320945668/photo/1">struck the Empire State Building</a>. More than 14,000 Consolidated Edison customers <a href="http://www.coned.com/newsroom/news/pr20160726.asp">lost power</a>.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="232" data-total-count="2670">The subway system steamed, then gurgled. \u201cExtensive delays on the F because of flooding, ladies and gentlemen!\u201d a conductor shouted at the West Fourth Street stop in the West Village, after the storm. \u201cFlooding in the tube!\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="121" data-total-count="2791">All week, passengers waited in the overpowering heat of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/nyregion/new-york-today-subway-sizzle.html?_r=0">uncooled subway stations</a> with eyes bulging and cheeks glistening<strong>.</strong></p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="36" data-total-count="2827">Still, there\u2019s no place like dome.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="580" data-total-count="3407">It seemed like good weather to spend sitting inside, watching something mellow, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfV5K_uJ-iM">a live stream of a corpse flower</a>, or Amorphophallus titanum<em>, </em>for example. The giant, pungent, phallic plant, native to Sumatra, was expected to bloom this week for the first time, after a decade, at the New York Botanical Garden. The flower finally began to unfurl on Thursday. Asked if the heat had caused the delay, Marc Hachadourian, director of the Nolen Greenhouses for Living Collections at the gardens, said, \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible, even though the plant is native to hot humid forests.</p>, <p class="summary"></p>, <p class="error captcha-error hidden">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>, <p class="error invalid-email-error hidden">Invalid email address.

Doing crazy stuff.\u201d He showed pictures and videos he had taken on his phone throughout the day. In one, a man was sprawled out on the rim of the fountain, his shirt off. A video showed a man berating two women sitting on a bench.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="334" data-total-count="4213">Amid it all, though, many continued to do exactly what they did before. Jennifer Gomez, 17, walked around for hours seemingly unaware of the hazy heat. When the skies broke open on Monday, she did not alter her pace. Was it because she welcomed the cooling raindrops? \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m playing Pokemon Go.\u201d</p>, <p>Jada Fitzpatrick and Megan Jula contributed reporting.</p>, <p class="story-print-citation">A version of this article appears in print on July 29, 2016, on Page A18 of the <span itemprop="printEdition">New York edition</span> with the headline: Heat Dome Over City Lifts.
