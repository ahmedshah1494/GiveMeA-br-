The audience was packed with diplomats and prominent Afghans, and the bomber made his way to the front row, where he <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/25/he-was-the-saviour-of-afghan-music-then-a-taliban-bomb-took-his-hearing" title="Guardian article.">blew himself up</a> next to a German spectator, killing him.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="594">A few seats away was Ahmad Naser Sarmast, the head of the school, the <a href="http://www.afghanistannationalinstituteofmusic.org/" title="The institute\u2019s website.">Afghanistan National Institute of Music</a>. Mr. Sarmast was badly injured in the blast, and <a class="meta-org" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/taliban/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the Taliban.">Taliban</a> statements soon made it clear that he had been the target.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="148" data-total-count="742">The Taliban were also angry about a student play performed as part of the concert that denounced suicide bombings, and sent a child as their bomber.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="324" data-total-count="1066">A year later, Mr. Sarmast has still not fully recovered. When a bomb goes off nearby, survivors\u2019 hearing is often destroyed. Mr. Sarmast was rendered nearly deaf, a potentially career-ending injury for a musician; he plays and teaches the trumpet and piano, in addition to running the school. Shrapnel lodged in his brain.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="1348" id="story-continues-2">An operation restored the hearing in his right ear, but he has only 20 to 30 percent hearing in the left. Doctors are waiting for that ear to heal naturally. If it does not, Mr. Sarmast expects to have another operation in the spring in Australia, where he has residency privileges.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="419" data-total-count="1767">None of this affected the school\u2019s busy schedule of performances in 2015, and Mr. Sarmast was back at work within weeks of the attack. He had already built the music institute into a renowned organization with appearances by its student ensembles all over the world, from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/arts/music/afghanistan-national-institute-of-music-students-to-tour-us.html" title="Times article.">Carnegie Hall</a> in New York to the Sydney Film Festival. This year, despite the bombing, the school won a Unesco award for innovation in education.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="2011">On a recent Sunday during term break, Mr. Sarmast was in his office after most of his staff had left, \u201cthe time when I really get to work,\u201d as he put it. He gestured at piles of paperwork on his desk. \u201cFund-raising, planning, thinking.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="2203">End-of-term exams had just finished, so there were no students around, and an empty campus can be a melancholy place. The playground is normally full, since classes and sessions are staggered.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="213" data-total-count="2416">Head scarves on girls are optional at the institute; some wear them, some do not. The school is thoroughly coeducational. It may be the only one in <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/afghanistan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about Afghanistan.">Afghanistan</a> with entirely mixed classrooms and musical ensembles.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="393" data-total-count="2809" id="story-continues-3">It is also not an expensive private school; it is a Ministry of Education institution, and most of the students are on scholarships. In fact, the poorest are paid by the school to attend: one of Mr. Sarmast\u2019s innovations. He hands out weekly stipends that are just high enough to make it uneconomical for the children\u2019s families to put them to work in the fields or begging in the streets.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="508" data-total-count="3317">Mr. Sarmast conceded, \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty rough year.\u201d After the suicide bombing, the Taliban said they had intended to assassinate Mr. Sarmast and would try again. Then information came from the National Directorate of Security, <a class="meta-loc" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/afghanistan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about Afghanistan.">Afghanistan</a>\u2019s intelligence agency, that a squad of four Taliban attackers was getting ready to storm the school. Later, the Australian Embassy warned Mr. Sarmast of credible threats to either the school or himself, and urged him to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible.</p>, <p class="summary"></p>, <p class="error captcha-error hidden">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>, <p class="error invalid-email-error hidden">Invalid email address.

He rattled off improvements. There are watchtowers now, as well as other security measures that he asked not be detailed.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="3999">What was most important to him, though, was making these changes in a way that did not arouse anxieties among students or their families, but made them feel safer in a society where bomb blasts are a regular feature of life.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="366" data-total-count="4365">The Taliban attack, though it killed one person and wounded more than a dozen others, also had a tremendously uplifting effect, as Mr. Sarmast described it. When he regained consciousness the day after the bombing, he was lying in a bed at Emergency, an Italian-run trauma hospital here, and the staff told him that 200 or 300 people were waiting outside to see him.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="4511">\u201cThey all came wanting to know if they could give blood or something, anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very amazing, very moving and touching.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="357" data-total-count="4868">That inspired him, he said. The school\u2019s Winter Music Academy had just begun, and the evening concert that was bombed had been a key part of it. The concerts were held once a week for eight weeks, with everyone in town invited. Those widely distributed invitations had apparently leaked out and reached the Taliban, so such events would no longer be wise.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="369" data-total-count="5237">Mr. Sarmast had an idea. He would make the evening concerts lunchtime affairs instead, and rather than inviting diplomats and socialites, the school would invite orphans and children from refugee camps to come to campus for concerts tailored to them. \u201cWhat could be better?\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the most music-deprived people in our society. And they loved it.\u201d</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="5481" id="story-continues-4">He figures the Taliban did him and the students a favor. Back when the insurgents were in power, they completely banned all but religious music; it is why they were determined to kill Mr. Sarmast. Instead, the school prospered after the attack.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="305" data-total-count="5786">Not only did he lose none of his expatriate music teachers, but he gained even more. For eight positions he had been unable to fill, he was suddenly deluged with applications from all over the world. \u201cFor two years, our cello position had been vacant,\u201d he said. \u201cOvernight, I had 10 applications.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="6057">Another Winter Music Academy, sponsored by the American Embassy and the Ministry of Education, will begin Jan. 9 and run through the end of February. Again, Mr. Sarmast said, the institute will hold its concerts for the poor, the orphaned, the deprived and the musicless.</p>, <p class="story-print-citation">A version of this article appears in print on December 31, 2015, on Page A8 of the <span itemprop="printEdition">New York edition</span> with the headline: A Music Teacher Keeps Playing After a Taliban Attack. <span class="story-footer-links"> <span><a href="http://www.nytreprints.com/" target="_blank">Order Reprints</a><span class="pipe">|</span></span> <span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html" target="_blank">Today's Paper</a><span class="pipe">|</span></span><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY" target="_blank">Subscribe</a></span>\n</span>\n</p>, <p class="feedback-message">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>, <p class="user-action"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">Go to Home Page \xbb</a></p>]
