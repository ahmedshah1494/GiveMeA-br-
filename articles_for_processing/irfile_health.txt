Ms. Reynolds, 84, had suffered from several health problems in recent years, and doctors said any number of factors could have contributed to her death, possibly from a <a class="meta-classifier" href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/stroke/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about strokes.">stroke</a>.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="546">But by all accounts, she and her daughter were very close in recent years, and death from a broken heart is a well-established occurrence, both in medical literature and throughout the folklore of the earliest human communities.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="213" data-total-count="759">One form of the phenomenon is called Takotsubo syndrome, after the Japanese term for \u201coctopus trap,\u201d because the heart looks as if it is caught from below, its upper chambers ballooning as if trying to escape.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="357" data-total-count="1116">The sudden loss of a child or spouse, perhaps foremost among life\u2019s cruelties, sets off \u201can overflow of stress hormones, and the heart can\u2019t take it,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women\u2019s heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. \u201cIt appears to be a massive heart attack,\u201d but, she said, \u201cthe heart is literally stunned.\u201d</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="263" data-total-count="1379" id="story-continues-2">The octopus trap can grab any heart, healthy or not, young or old, and most people survive, doctors say. The sudden flood of stress hormones causes a temporary weakening of the heart muscle itself, unlike a classic heart attack, in which a clot blocks blood flow.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="395" data-total-count="1774" id="story-continues-3">\u201cI\u2019ve seen estimates that about 1 percent of perceived heart attacks\u201d are because of broken-heart syndrome, said Dr. Anne Curtis, chair of medicine at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo, \u201cand that seems about right. I think every cardiologist has seen cases. We tell people that many will return to normal or near-normal heart function.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="2058">Ms. Reynolds\u2019s did not, though the timing of her death may have just coincided with her daughter\u2019s. In her 2013 memoir, Ms. Reynolds wrote about suffering a mini-stroke and partial <a class="meta-classifier" href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/acute-kidney-failure/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Acute kidney failure.">kidney failure</a>. In 2015, she was awarded an honorary Oscar but was too sick to attend the ceremony.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="385" data-total-count="2443">In interviews, Ms. Fisher had talked about how frail her mother was. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of times terrifying, but watching my mother, who\u2019s incredibly resilient, coping with certain health issues that she\u2019s had,\u201d she told National Public Radio this fall. In an interview with People magazine in May, she said her mother had had a \u201cspinal issue\u201d but had \u201crecovered amazingly.\u201d</p>, <p class="summary"></p>, <p class="error captcha-error hidden">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>, <p class="error invalid-email-error hidden">Invalid email address.

On Wednesday, Ms. Reynolds was rushed to an emergency room amid reports that she had possibly had a stroke.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="371" data-total-count="3043">Yet \u2014 if indeed a stroke was the primary cause of death, as her son, Todd Fisher, has said \u2014 a heart squeezed by the sudden loss of a beloved daughter could have contributed. The stunned organ, especially in a person who might have had any of the underlying cardiovascular infirmities of aging, could increase the likelihood of a clot forming and moving to the brain.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="524" data-total-count="3567">In a 2005 paper in The New England Journal of Medicine, doctors at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine reviewed cases of 18 women and one man who landed in coronary care units in Baltimore, between 1999 and 2003, with chest pains and no signs of classic heart attack on exam. Most were older, but one was 27 and another 32. The doctors, led by Dr. Ilan Wittstein, nicknamed the condition broken-heart syndrome and noted that it occurred not only after grief but after any sudden stress. All of the patients survived.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="3801">\u201cWe had people who\u2019d been held up at gunpoint, who\u2019d been up in front of a group to speak, who were severely claustrophobic and in an <a class="meta-classifier" href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/mri/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about MRI.">M.R.I.</a> scanner, who were angry and in heated arguments,\u201d Dr. Wittstein said in an interview.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="419" data-total-count="4220">Dr. Wittstein said that at the time the paper appeared virtually the only mentions of the syndrome were in Japanese medical literature. Now, he said, thousands of cases have been reported, and about 90 percent of them are women in middle age or older. One possible reason, he said, is that <a class="meta-classifier" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/estrogen/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival health news about estrogen.">estrogen</a> protects the heart\u2019s smaller vessels \u2014 those most affected by stress hormones \u2014 and estrogen levels drop with age.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="354" data-total-count="4574">There have been cases of well-known couples dying in close succession. The country stars Johnny and June Cash died within months of each other, after a long marriage. The former football star Doug Flutie\u2019s parents died on the same day, both of heart attacks. To some medical experts, what Ms. Reynolds experienced is one of the greatest traumas of all.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="4836">\u201cNo one wants to change the order of nature, that is the first thing I thought when I heard,\u201d said Dr. Victor Fornari, a psychiatrist at Northwell Health on Long Island. \u201cA parent outliving a child \u2014 it\u2019s one of the most unspeakable things there is.\u201d</p>, <p class="story-print-citation">A version of this article appears in print on December 30, 2016, on Page A16 of the <span itemprop="printEdition">New York edition</span> with the headline: Debbie Reynolds Was Ill, but Science Finds Basis for Death by Heartbreak. <span class="story-footer-links"> <span><a href="http://www.nytreprints.com/" target="_blank">Order Reprints</a><span class="pipe">|</span></span> <span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html" target="_blank">Today's Paper</a><span class="pipe">|</span></span><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp839RF.html?campaignId=48JQY" target="_blank">Subscribe</a></span>\n</span>\n</p>, <p class="feedback-message">We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page. <strong>Tell us what you think.</strong></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Access to NYTimes.com and all NYTimes apps</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Unlimited article access, anytime, anywhere</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Times Insider Access, including behind-the-scenes stories, exclusive events, podcasts, and e-books</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">1 complimentary digital subscription to give anyone you'd like</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">Customized delivery options such as Sunday only, Fri.-Sun., weekday delivery, or daily delivery</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">The weekly Sunday magazine and monthly T Magazine</p>, <p class="feature-text bullet">2 complimentary digital subscriptions to give anyone you'd like</p>, <p class="feature-text"><a class="learn-more" data-target="learn-more" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8K6QF.html?campaignId=6KJKJ">Learn more <span class="arrow">\u25ba</span></a></p>, <p class="user-action"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">Go to Home Page \xbb</a></p>]
