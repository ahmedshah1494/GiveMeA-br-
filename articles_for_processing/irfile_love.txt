This is a considered trilateral conversation between a patient, their loved ones and clinicians. Except for palliative care teams, the health care professionals entrusted to shepherd most of us to our deaths require better training. Poetry and engagement with the humanities not only enhance a doctor\u2019s empathy, but are requisite to all of us living meaningfully.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="854" data-total-count="1461">I have attended severely injured accident victims.

I believe that dying at an old and infirm age is not something to be raged against or resisted at all cost. For all of us and every day, life ebbs away at a varied pace.

The pain of love, once present in treatises and medical textbooks, has disappeared from the medical vocabulary. But is there still lovesickness nowadays? In poetry and in ancient Egyptian writings, as well as in the works of classical Greek antiquity, the symptoms of the disease are described in detail. The lovesick change color, suffer insomnia and burn with fever; their tongues stick to the palate; they even become crazy and die of love. In the medical tradition, lovesickness led to general dryness of the body, rashes, dry eyes, worn appearance and so on. And what about today? In some forms, the passion of love, unrequited love, is a real disease, underestimated by mental health experts.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="414" data-total-count="2856" id="story-continues-2">Having a \u201cbroken heart\u201d consumed with love can translate into a real physical and mental disease accompanied by a constellation of symptoms leading to a typical picture of \u201cmajor depression,\u201d according to the severity: delusion, depression/elation, crisis crying, insomnia, mood swings, loss of appetite, inability to concentrate and obsessive-compulsive disorders like dependency on email and smartphones.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="3136" id="story-continues-3">Love can also be folly.

Forster and appreciated her comment that his \u201ctime and place .\u2008.\u2008. terrorized him\u201d into writing in \u201ccode\u201d about sex. Yet the remark simultaneously obscures key points about the era and its concerns. By the time Forster published \u201cHowards End\u201d in 1910, fiction and nonfiction in the English-speaking world had been saturated with discussions of sex for several decades, as Michel Foucault understood. Starting at least with Rider Haggard\u2019s \u201cKing Solomon\u2019s Mines\u201d (1885) and \u201cShe\u201d (1887), physical desire and how to handle it became widely explored if tension-ridden topics. In 1894, George du Maurier published \u201cTrilby,\u201d a fabulously successful novel that centers first on the fresh sensuality of the eponymous heroine/victim, then on her manipulation and downfall at the hands of Svengali. The following year saw the appearance of several novels fraught with sexual tension: Thomas Hardy\u2019s \u201cJude the Obscure,\u201d which details the struggles of the sensitive hero in contrast both to his utterly earthy wife and the clumsily named Sue Bridehead, who is incapable of passion yet, pathetically, bears him several children; an early foray by the blunt Victoria Cross (pseudonym of Annie Sophie Cory), \u201cThe Woman Who Didn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 sleep with the man she loves, although they both suffer greatly from unrequited passion; and the American Hamlin Garland\u2019s \u201cRose of Dutcher\u2019s Coolly,\u201d about the sensual awakening of a girl who becomes a successful New Woman. Bram Stoker\u2019s \u201cDracula\u201d (1897), Kate Chopin\u2019s \u201cThe Awakening\u201d (1899) and many other works of the period explored sexual themes.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="517" data-total-count="5579">Of course, Forster would have been keenly aware of Oscar Wilde\u2019s work, open sensuality and conviction for \u201cgross indecency\u201d in 1895. As a closeted gay man, he would surely have known of Richard Krafft-Ebing\u2019s \u201cPsychopathia Sexualis,\u201d available in English, and quite possibly of Sigmund Freud\u2019s opinions on sexual \u201cinversion.\u201d In brief, Forster had no shortage of material to ponder about sex, coded and open. The only thing new in recent decades is the elaborate, graphic description of sexual acts.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="215" data-total-count="5794">Incidentally, James Ivory\u2019s film version of \u201cHowards End\u201d (1992), starring Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins, makes the twisted plot and relationships of the story more plausible than Forster did in the novel.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="18" data-total-count="5812">ROBERT W.
