Preventive actions
Strengthening management
In many countries, school management often includes
not only senior education staff but also a school
management committee composed of community
representatives. However, particularly in unstable
settings, school management may be politicized or
biased, discriminating against members of certain
cultural, linguistic, ethnic or religious minorities,
thereby potentially making schools more vulnerable to
attack.236 Ensuring the full participation of excluded
groups in school management committees may
reduce threats to schools, teachers and students.237 In
Nepal, there seemed to be a correlation between
democratic elections to select committee members
and reduced threat of attack.238 In Afghanistan,
community involvement in the management of
schools encouraged greater vigilance against
attack.239 In addition, representative management
structures may more effectively implement other
protective actions outlined below. However, the
voluntary nature of these committees can lead to slow
progress, high turnover or lack of willingness to participate.240

Negotiation
Many instances have shown that local actors,
including school management committees,
community and religious leaders, and village elders,
may be effective at negotiating with potential perpetrators of attacks, particularly when the attackers are
trying to gain the community’s support or are
community members themselves. Religious leaders
and religious groups may also have greater success in
negotiating with parties to conflict when they draw

In one case in Nepal, a Village Development Council

community buildings instead of schools to ensure that
education facilities retained a politically neutral
profile.242
The approach taken to negotiations depends upon the
perpetrators and motives of attack. At times, transparent and public negotiations may be most effective
since they ensure awareness of agreements, for
