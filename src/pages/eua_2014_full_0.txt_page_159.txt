
a head teacher at a primary school funded by
ExxonMobil in Eket, also in the south-east, was
abducted in October 2010.1170
Some shootings also occurred in the north, including
at a military-run secondary school near Kano in
December 2011, which left four air force personnel
dead and two injured, but the perpetrators and
motives were unknown.1171 Similarly, another shooting
resulted in the death of the head teacher of the
Government Day Secondary School in Potiskum, Yobe
state, in October 2012. According to a witness, when
he discovered the head teacher’s occupation, one of
the gunmen said: ‘You are the type of people we are
looking for.’1172
Later, in 2013, militants began targeting students and
teachers (see Attacks on education in 2013 below).
In addition, one incident appeared to be linked to
Boko Haram: the killing of Sheik Bashir Mustapha, a
prominent Muslim cleric critical of Boko Haram, and
one of his students, while he was teaching in his home
in October 2010.1173

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education facilities
Boko Haram was believed to be responsible for a
series of threats to, and bombings of, universities in
2011-2012. In July 2011, during a spate of Boko Haram
attacks in Maiduguri, officials shut the campus of
Maiduguri University after receiving an anonymous
letter warning that the student senate and examinations and records buildings would be burned down.1174
Hours later, two lecturers were reportedly killed during
clashes that took place between Boko Haram and
military forces near the campus.1175 In September 2011,
at least 15 universities reportedly received an email
message from Boko Haram, warning them that their
campuses were on a target list for bombings.1176 Boko
Haram also claimed responsibility for bomb attacks on
universities in Kano and Gombe in late April 2012.1177
The attack in Kano took place at Bayero University,
where around 20 people were killed by explosives and
gunfire while worshipping at two Christian church
services on campus, one held indoors and the other
outdoors; at Gombe University, a building was
bombed but no one was injured.1178

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Attacks on higher education students, teachers and
personnel
At least 25 people, most of them students,1179 were
killed when unknown gunmen burst into a university
residence in the north-eastern town of Mubi, in
Adamawa state, on the night of 1 October 2012, and
shot victims or slit their throats.1180 Earlier, a demand
to evacuate the university, widely believed to have
been written by Boko Haram, had been posted on a
women’s student hostel.1181
In addition to students, university staff members were
also targeted for attack, mainly in the south. Seven
university staff members were kidnapped from the
Federal College of Education, Rivers state, between
January and October 2012, and one of them died,
allegedly from torture.1182 Between 2010 and 2012, six
other higher education personnel were abducted in
the south, including two professors at the University of
Uyo; the Director of Continuing Education at the
College of Education in Afaha Nisit, Akwa Ibom; the
Provost of the College of Health Sciences at the
Nnamdi Azikiwe University; the Vice-Chancellor of
Enugu State University of Technology; and the Delta
State Commissioner for Higher Education.1183 In the
north, one lecturer from the University of Maiduguri
was also shot and killed, reportedly by Boko Haram.1184
Violence also occurred due to sectarian clashes.
During post-election violence in April 2011, on the
outskirts of Zaria in northern Kaduna state, a mob of
youths supporting former military leader Mohammadu
Buhari, who backed the imposition of sharia law in the
north, cornered four Christian students and a Christian
lecturer in the staff quarters of the campus of Nuhu
Bamalli Polytechnic and beat them to death with
sticks, clubs and machetes.1185

Attacks on education in 2013
Schools, universities, students and teachers were
attacked in northern Nigeria. A majority of these
incidents were suspected to be the work of Boko
Haram, which claimed responsibility in several
cases.1186 According to Amnesty International, more
than 50 schools were attacked and partially destroyed
or burned down in the first seven months of 2013,
most of them in Borno state and a few in neighbouring

Yobe state.1187 In the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, an
official reported to Amnesty that at least five
government secondary schools and nine private
schools were burned down between January and
April.1188 According to one Borno State Ministry of
Education official, some 15,000 children in the state
stopped attending classes between February and May
as a result of attacks.1189
While most previous attacks on schools had targeted
infrastructure and were carried out at night when
schools were empty, there appeared to be a marked
change in tactics with reports of teachers and school
students increasingly targeted.1190 In March, at least
three teachers were killed and three students
seriously injured in a simultaneous attack on four
schools in Maiduguri.1191 In June, two secondary
schools were targeted in Yobe and Borno states: seven
students and two teachers were killed when
suspected Boko Haram militants attacked their school
in Damaturu;1192 and the following day, gunmen
attacked a school in Maiduguri while students were
sitting their examinations, killing nine students.1193
In one incident in July, gunmen attacked a government
secondary boarding school in Mamudo, Yobe state, at
night, while students were sleeping. Sections of the
school and dormitory were set ablaze, and a number
of students were shot as they tried to escape. At least
22 students and one teacher were killed.1194
School teachers appeared to be targeted specifically,
with some 30 reported to have been shot dead,
sometimes during class, from January to
September.1195 A number of teachers also said they
had been intimidated by Boko Haram elements or
subjected to close surveillance by the group in remote
towns in Borno state.1196 In a video statement made in
July 2013, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau
threatened teachers, saying: ‘School teachers who are
teaching Western education? We will kill them! We will
kill them!’; he also endorsed recent school attacks
and claimed that non-Islamic schools should be
burned down.1197
One major attack also occurred on a college in Yobe
state in September. Unknown gunmen suspected to
be affiliated with Boko Haram entered the campus of
the Yobe State College of Agriculture in the middle of
