tribe were chiefly responsible for the attacks. As noted
below (see Military use of schools), both government
and anti-government forces used schools for military
purposes, which reportedly provoked numerous
attacks. The attacks and school closures due to
fighting disrupted the education of 200,000 children
in 2011.1707
In November-December 2011, there was a steep rise in
reporting of attacks on schools to the UN due to rapid
assessment missions conducted by the Child
Protection Sub-cluster and the Yemeni Department of
Education. They reported 204 incidents of schools
being looted, shelled, aerially bombarded and set on
fire; education personnel being threatened; and
schools being used for military purposes.1708
In January-February 2012, 13 schools used as polling
stations were attacked or otherwise damaged, for
example, when government forces clashed with
members of the southern separatist movement AlHirak in or around school buildings. In other cases,
militants looted schools or threw sound bombs to
prevent people from entering to vote.1709
On 24 April 2012, a grenade was launched at a school
in which IDPs were sheltering in Aden district.1710
Attacks on education in 2012 peaked in May and June,
with 181 of the 252 incidents reported that year.1711 Half
of those took place in Sana’a, where the government
continued to fight anti-government forces intermittently, including 44 cases of bombs exploding in the
vicinity of schools.1712 In the same period, there were
78 incidents affecting Abyan’s schools as the military
cracked down on AQAP fighters in the area.1713 Those
responsible included the Republican Guards, antigovernment tribal groups and Ansar Al-Sharia (a
militant Islamic group connected to AQAP).1714
Between July and October 2012, a few isolated
incidents were reported. For instance, on 27 July 2012,
Houthi armed militants stormed into Omar Ibn AlKhattab primary school where students were
attending summer classes, and demanded that they
study the Houthi handbook.1715 On 29 September
2012, in Abyan, a group of armed students allegedly
associated with Ansar Al-Sharia entered school facilities, burning textbooks and destroying furniture to
disrupt the classes.1716
