• Children have reported receiving military
training in madrassas (Islamic schools) in the
border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan from
armed groups active in these areas.380

Illegal recruitment of child soldiers
Many non-state armed groups have taken advantage
of schools as locations where children gather, to
recruit them into their forces.
• In April 2012, mutineers under General Bosco
Ntaganda rounded up over 30 male students at
Mapendano secondary school, in Masisi
territory, DRC. The boys and young men were
tied up, taken to a military camp and inducted
into Ntaganda’s forces.381
• The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC) engaged in child recruitment campaigns
in schools. In September 2008, they entered a
school in the department of Cauca where 800
students were studying and invited the children
to join the group.382
• In Somalia, Al-Shabaab militants have systematically used schools as recruiting grounds.
They have regularly visited schools and forcibly
removed children from classrooms, often at
gunpoint. They have lined up students,
selected those they deem fit to serve as fighters
and suicide bombers, and taken them back to
their training camps.383

Temporary shelter
Armed forces and armed groups sometimes use
schools and university buildings as temporary shelter,
either from incoming attacks or simply for protection
from the elements.
• In Colombia, army helicopters occasionally use
school playing fields and playgrounds as
landing sites for the unloading of personnel
and weapons.384
• In July 2010, the Myanmar government’s armed
forces temporarily sheltered from the rain in a
school in the village of Tha Dah Der, in the
north-eastern Karen state. Local residents had
already fled the area and the soldiers had
burned most of the buildings in the village.
