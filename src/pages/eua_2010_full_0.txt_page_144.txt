The information gathered in the reports is highly valued for accountability purposes”. However, his is a voluntary position and he is given scant resources. “The major assistance that governments and NGOs can provide UN special procedures is facilitating their work: support investigations, enable them to make country visits and establish processes to monitor progress on the recommendations made in their reports,” he says.318The first steps towards building a potential movement or coalition on this issue have been made, particularly via the expert seminar ‘Protecting Education from Attack’ in September 2009, which was attended by 70 or so representatives from interested organizations. The challenge ahead is to harness the strengths of all those organizations with an interest in this issue to build on the progress being made on Children and Armed Conflict issues and on the momentum regarding Education in Emergencies in order to achieve protection against attacks for all involved in education, and to ensure that no sector is left behind in this regard. If Education for All is to be achieved, such concerted action is imperative.
