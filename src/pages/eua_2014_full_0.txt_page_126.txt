longer exists as an armed group; several other armed
‘local defence’ groups known as the Mai Mai; and,
from April 2012 to November 2013, the largely Tutsi-led
rebel group M23. The Ugandan rebel-group the Lord’s
Resistance Army (LRA) has also been fighting in the
north since 2006.637
School closures in conflict areas, damage of educational facilities, fear of abduction by armed groups
and widespread displacement have led to many
children and young people missing out on education
in the east.638
The country’s vast size and the remoteness of many of
the places where attacks occur, combined with
ongoing insecurity, make it difficult to accurately
monitor attacks. Many of the areas where they have
occurred are not accessible by road, and armed groups
are still in control. However, since the conflict began,
significant incidents of forced recruitment from
schools and along school routes, shooting or
abduction of students and staff, sexual violence
committed en route to and from school, looting and
burning of schools, occupation of education buildings
by military forces and armed groups, and persecution
of academics have been documented.639
In 2011, gross primary enrolment in DRC was 105 per
cent, gross secondary enrolment was 43 per cent and
gross tertiary enrolment was 8 per cent.640 Adult
literacy was 67 per cent in 2010.641

Attacks on schools
Attacks on education during 2009-2012 mostly
occurred in the eastern provinces, where rebel groups
and the Congolese Army were active. From October
2008 to December 2009, the UN reported 51 attacks
on schools by armed forces and armed groups.642 In
2010, at least 14 schools were attacked,643 while in
2011 the UN recorded 53 incidents against schools
and health centres.644 Of these, the FDLR was responsible for 21 cases of destruction and looting, and Mai
Mai groups for six, but the Congolese Army and the
Allied Democratic Forces-National Army for the
Liberation of Uganda (ADF-Nalu) were also responsible for some incidents.645
In 2012, the reported number of attacks increased
significantly, due mainly to fighting between FARDC
