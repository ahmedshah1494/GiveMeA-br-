Giving parents and students a say in the running of schools is one way to ensure that these sensitivities are addressed. Curriculum content that can also make a positive contribution includes the use of inquiry-based history teaching methods and curricula to tackle controversial local history; the teaching of education for mutual understanding, common and diverse cultural heritage, and conflict resolution; and the promotion of curriculum or research collaboration between students and staff from both sides in divided communities. It also includes creating an ethos of tolerance, fairness and understanding.All of these have been tried for many years in Northern Ireland, for instance, where Catholic teachers were issued with a blanket death threat by an armed group in 2002 – although experts are divided on their impact, given that children from both sides still largely attend separate school, and education is competing with the influence of sectarianism in children’s families and communities.266Similarly, in higher education, tackling the restriction or distortion of content, limitations on academic freedom and bias in the way staff are hired may contribute to ending conflict and building peace and stability. Hester Luna Paanakker’s explorative study on attacks on higher education in Iraq, based on researching the views of academics who fled the country after the American invasion, found that the way higher education was being run was perceived as fostering an environment in which the large-scale and specific targeting of academics for political reasons took place. This politicization took the form of favouritism, selectivity, repressiveness and corruption on sectarian lines. More research is needed into the place of academic freedom in the relationship between conflict, political violence and higher education.267
