The reports are approximately 18 pages long and chronicle all violations reported by the MRM Task Force in the relevant country, identify action taken and make recommendations. The subgroup debates them and makes recommendations on them to the Secretary-General concerning what time-bound action he should instruct the parties to conflict to take.272 The MRM Task Force in each country is a coalition of willing partners, which reports to the UN Country Team. The Country Team is chaired by a representative of the Secretary-General or the Resident Coordinator, with a vice-chair usually from UNICEF, or otherwise from OHCHR, UNHCR, DPKO or ILO. The Task Force members are UN agencies, NGOs and other civil society bodies, usually organizations which are heavily involved in child protection or human rights monitoring. The proportion of non-UN agencies involved varies between different countries.
