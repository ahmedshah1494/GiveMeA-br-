Compliance is monitored by the treaty bodies, which report to the General Assembly, and the Human Rights Council with its Special Rapporteurs, including the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, and the Universal Periodic Review, which reviews progress of every state in realizing human rights. Other accountability mechanisms include the UN Security Council; the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict; the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children; and the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights. Security Council mechanisms include recommendations and resolutions, which may establish systems of reporting and time-bound action plans, as with SC Resolution 1612.296Under IHL (also known as the laws of war), which covers both international and non-international armed conflict,297 civilians (including students, teachers, academics and other education personnel) and civilian objects (including school buildings and transport) must never be targeted for attack; an attack must not cause “excessive” or disproportionate incidental loss (collateral damage) to civilians in relation to the direct military advantage anticipated; and the weapons or methods must not cause an unreasonable (disproportionate) amount of suffering to human beings. Violations of any of these rules fall into the most serious category of war crime.298These rules apply to political leaders of states and commanders of state forces who make decisions about the conduct of warfare, but also to the political leaders and commanders of NSOAGs. In addition, individual soldiers of both state forces and NSOAGs are obligated to comply with them and their commanders can be held criminally responsible for violations committed by others.299The most significant obligation to armed groups is contained in Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions 1949, which applies to “each Party to the conflict”. The article specifies that certain acts directed towards those who are not taking part in hostilities (such as teachers and students) are prohibited. These include murder, mutilation, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages and outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.300
