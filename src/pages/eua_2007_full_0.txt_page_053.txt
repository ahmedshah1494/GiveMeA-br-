In addition, they typically disrupt and undermine the provision of education, access to education and the quality of education in a number of different ways:pupils and staff stay at home because of fear of further attacks.  pupils and staff ﬂ ee the area or country for fear of being targeted.  buildings, materials and resources are destroyed or damaged.  forced recruitment or voluntary enlistment of child soldiers prevents children   from going to school.physical removal by abduction, detention or disappearance prevents teachers   and students from going to school or university.murders and assassinations deny students their teachers who may be irreplaceable   in some areas.psychological trauma, fear and stress, caused by any of the above, hinder learning   and teaching, affecting attention, motivation and attendance of both students and staff.In the areas with the most incidents, the impact of violent attacks on education provision has been devastating. Given that up to 40 per cent of the 77 million or more children in the world who are not attending school can be found in countries affected by conﬂ ict, understanding the impact of such attacks is crucial to attempts to achieve Education for All worldwide. But in relatively developed countries, too, the targeting of schools or universities can lead to a collapse of a previously admired system.
