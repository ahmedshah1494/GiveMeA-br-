This should increase attention to sexual violence and killing and injuring of students at or on the way to or from school, but not necessarily attacks on school buildings and the killing of school teachers and other education personnel.Given that all six violations are to be monitored wherever listing is triggered, this expansion of criteria for listing may benefit the monitoring and reporting of attacks on schools because it may widen the number of countries being observed.However, the reality is that the non-trigger violations, in general, and attacks on schools, in particular, seem to get far less attention and few recommendations have been made on how to improve protection of students and schools. A Human Rights Watch analysis of the Security Council’s response to two violations, sexual violence and attacks on education, found that although the monitoring and reporting mechanism documents all six grave violations, in practice violations other than the recruitment and use of child soldiers have received only superficial attention.According to the analysis, the Secretary-General has issued nine country reports on children and armed conflict since the beginning of 2008 and the Security Council Working Group has issued ten separate sets of conclusions on individual situations. These 19 documents included a total of 141 separate recommendations related to the recruitment and use of child soldiers, but only 18 recommendations on sexual violence and only six related to attacks on education. Seven of the 19 documents include no recommendations on either sexual violence or attacks on education, even in situations where the Secretary-General has described rates of sexual violence as “alarming” and where attacks on schools have also been cited.276Similarly, a 2008 Humanitarian Practice Network study, supported by Save the Children, concluded that monitoring and reporting and responses to grave violations other than recruitment were “limited and patchy”, and that the situation would not change as long as child recruitment remained the only criterion for inclusion in the annexes. It noted that Security Council members had expressed concern that in situations where schools are subject to attacks their situation would “not be afforded any thorough scrutiny” unless specific instances of recruitment are found.277 If this pattern is repeated with the two new trigger violations, it is unlikely that attacks on schools will be monitored adequately by the MRM.Human Rights Watch recommended that the UN Security Council should mandate UN Country Teams to expand the dialogue with parties to armed conflict to achieve
