communities and therefore may have been more
responsive to their efforts to re-open or protect
schools.294
As a result of these factors some communities were
able to more effectively engage in actions like negotiating curriculum, undertaking dialogue with armed
groups or hiring local staff.295 Engaging communities
to negotiate for girls’ education may prove more
difficult in some situations, however, if perpetrators of
attacks on girls’ schools come from within the
community or have support there, which the CARE
study found sometimes to be the case.296 This
suggests it may be important to take into account
potential opposition to girls’ education within the
community when considering negotiation as a
protection measure.
Community members reported to CARE that they were
less likely to know or be able to negotiate with criminal
or outsider perpetrators. In these cases, activities like
investing in physical security, hiring guards and
increasing school patrols may be more appropriate.297
The CARE study also found that schools may be less
targeted where the community itself requested the
school or was deeply involved before establishing the
school.298 The association of schools with certain
international donors or military forces may place
schools at increased risk in the specific context of
Afghanistan.299
Evidence from Afghanistan shows that community
engagement must be tailored to each locale in order to
protect education most effectively. Therefore, the flexibility of programme strategies, objectives and
implementation plans is critical. Overall, the
‘community-involved’ type of approach appears to
hold little, if any, sway in the Afghan context, while
complex and site-specific permutations of the other
three approaches are evident.

Challenges of working with
community groups
The advantages of working with communities may
include: lower costs, ensuring actions taken are
tailored to context, achieving sustainability and
gaining credibility with parties to the conflict.
