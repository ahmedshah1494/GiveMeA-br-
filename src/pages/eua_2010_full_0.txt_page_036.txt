The SRF is not the only scholar rescue network and the figures may be distorted by factors that either restrict access to SRF information or deter people from applying for its grants. These may be linguistic, cultural, historical, technological or related to censorship and security measures. As a result, it is does not represent a comprehensive global survey of the problem. Nevertheless, it does offer an indication of where many incidents of persecution have occurred.The SRF study finds that incidents of persecution of scholars - ranging from harassment to imprisonment, violence and assassination - occurred in at least 101 countries. An analysis of 847 applications for SRF grants globally from 2002 to 2007 suggests sub-Saharan Africa was the worst-affected region (323 applicants), followed by the Middle East and North Africa (201). According to authors Henry Jarecki and Daniela Zane Kaisth: “About five per cent of scholars in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one per cent of all scholars in sub-Saharan Africa have applied to the Scholar Rescue Fund for help during SRF’s first five years”.The top ten countries by number of applicants to SRF during the period studied were Iraq (111), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (47), China (46), Zimbabwe (34), West Bank and Gaza (30), Nigeria (28), Burma (26), Cameroon (25), Ethiopia (25) and India (25). The top ten by SRF applicants per thousands of academic population were Guinea-Bissau (62.50), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (52.57), Eritrea (27.97), Liberia (16.84), Togo (12.89), Burundi (11.13), Rwanda (8.26), Cameroon (7.88), Botswana (5.67) and Mauritania (0.64).In three out of four cases of persecution of scholars applying to the SRF, the perpetrators were government agents. In one out of four cases, the perpetrators were non-state agents such as terrorists, militias, paramilitary personnel, rebel forces and religious groups.Two of the most disturbing trends in attacks on education have been, first, the alleged mass abduction and indoctrination of schoolchildren in Pakistan and Iraq to become suicide bombers53 and, second, the targeted killing of schoolchildren so young that they could scarcely be considered a political threat, as has occurred in Afghanistan and elsewhere. What had they done to provoke their killers? They had simply gone to school.
