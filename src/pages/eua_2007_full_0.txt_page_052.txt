Even if released, they will be in danger of being killed by those who have threatened Samuel and his family”.It said Colombia faced a “human rights crisis” because there is impunity in 90 per cent of cases of human rights abuses against trade unionists. Only decisive action to bring justice to those responsible for International human rights abuses would have a signiﬁ cant impact on the situation, Amnesty International said. It called on solidarity groups worldwide to press their own governments “to put pressure on the Colombian authorities to take measures to stop the killings and the persecution of trade unionists and activists”.
