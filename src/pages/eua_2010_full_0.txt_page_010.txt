Incidents of persecution of academics continue: a survey of Scholar Rescue Fund applicants found them most common in sub-Saharan Africa, Iraq and the West Bank and Gaza over the period from 2002 to 2007.7Mostly, attacks occur in conflict-affected countries or under regimes with a poor record on human rights and democratic pluralism. From 2007 to 2009, state forces or state-backed forces have either beaten, arrested, tortured, threatened with murder or shot dead students, teachers and/or academics in Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, Honduras, Iran, Myanmar, Nepal, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, Zambia and Zimbabwe.Data challenges and definitionsWithout a global system for systematically monitoring or gathering verified data, all figures on attacks come with a statistical health warning that they are compiled from disparate information sources of varying quality – media, human rights reports and some UN monitoring. Many may not have been verified. In addition, there is no agreed common data set enabling accurate analysis of trends across countries.
