schoolchildren for going to school and many students
turned up for classes. However, at one school only 100
of the 3,000 pupils turned up amid threats of further
violence,769 and when protests began some schools
sent children home because they feared for their
safety. Supporters of the separatist movement
Hurriyet attacked school buses carrying children to
schools. For example, on 7 October 2010, at least
three students from a private school in Rainawari,
Kashmir, were reportedly injured when a school bus
was attacked by protesters throwing stones at it. On
the same day, protesters pelted a school bus in Soura,
but no injuries were reported. In a later incident in
December 2010, Hurriyet supporters ordered a driver

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education occurred during 20092012, but they tended to be isolated incidents, most
