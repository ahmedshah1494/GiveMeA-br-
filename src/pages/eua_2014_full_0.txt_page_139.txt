Some students were killed when security forces raided
university dormitories. Other students and academics
were arrested, imprisoned or sentenced to death on
charges based on confessions obtained under torture.
Academics specializing in nuclear physics and
engineering were assassinated.802

Context
The reporting period witnessed many protests against
the government’s attempts to block reformists from
power. The protests, in which students played an
important role, were sparked largely by the controversial re-election of conservative Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad as president in June 2009. The subsequent suppression of protesters led to a large
number of human rights violations,803 with journalists,
students, academics and political activists
imprisoned.804 Further protests erupted in 2011, partly
influenced by the Arab Spring.805 Iran’s security forces,
apparently supported by the justice system, repressed
the dissent with methods that included arbitrary
arrest, imprisonment and torture.806
Failure to use due process led to extreme cases of
injustice, including arbitrary execution. For instance,
in 2010, Farzad Kamangar, a Kurdish teacher with
alleged links to the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party
(PKK), was reportedly tortured while in custody and
was sentenced to death, and subsequently executed,
after a seven-minute trial in which no evidence was
presented.807
From 2007 to 2013, the Iranian authorities systematically discriminated against politically active students
by partially or completely banning them from higher
education.808 Independent student organizations
were also banned and faculty were purged,809 and the
social sciences and humanities curricula were
restricted.810 In total, at least 250 students and
professors were expelled from April 2005 to March
2013.811 According to a compilation of media and
human rights sources, from 2009 more than 200
university teachers were forced to retire each year,
reportedly because they did not ‘share the regime’s
direction’ or support the rule of the Supreme Leader.812

Furthermore, followers of the Baha’i faith were barred
officially from attending higher education from 1979,
and from 2009 they were increasingly harassed in
schools by staff.813 Several Baha’is affiliated with the
Baha’i Institute for Higher Education – an alternative
online system of teaching set up because Baha’is
were barred from universities – were arrested.814 The
activities of the institute were declared illegal and its
diplomas and degrees were denied legal validity.815
The UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human
Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran said Baha’is face
institutionalized persecution and the government’s
own documents revealed a policy to deprive them of
education.816
The election of Hassan Rouhani as President on 14
June 2013 raised hopes of political reform, and
signalled an apparent thawing in relations abroad817
and a more liberal policy towards those in education
at home, including the reinstatement of some
students and professors.818
In 2011, net enrolment at primary school level was 100
per cent, while at secondary level it was estimated at
79 per cent. Gross enrolment in tertiary education was
49 per cent. The adult literacy rate was 85 per cent
(2008).819

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
According to Human Rights Watch, at least 39 teachers
were detained between January 2009 and October
2012 on charges related to national security, many of
them in connection with their activities as teacher
trade unionists. For example, 15 were imprisoned
because of their trade union activity, including
protests for higher wages.820 Some teacher trade
unionists received long and severe sentences.821 In
one case, the former head of the Mashad
Headteachers’ Union was sentenced to six years in
prison in 2009 on charges relating to his trade union
activity. The sentence was later reduced to two years,
but when he was due to be released he was tried on a
new charge of ‘creating public anxiety’.822

Attacks on higher education
In 2009 alone, there were at least 30 attacks on
universities and colleges, including campus raids and
arrests of students, faculty and staff.823
Attacks on academics and students primarily came in
the context of anti-government protests. However,
there was also a pattern of targeted killings of those
specializing in physics and engineering. Iranian
officials alleged that these incidents were perpetrated
by foreigners and related to the development of the
country’s nuclear capacity. Among these, on 12
January 2010, a remote-controlled bomb placed on the
motorcycle of Massoud Ali-Mohammadi, 50, a
physicist at Tehran University, detonated outside his
apartment as he was heading to work, killing him
instantly.824 This was followed by similar assassinations of Majid Shahriari, a nuclear engineer at Tehran
University, on 29 November 2010 and academic
Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan on 11 January 2012. Another
nuclear physicist, Fereidoun Abbasi,was wounded on
29 November 2010.825 Further, on 23 July 2011, two
gunmen on motorcycles killed a student who was
studying for a master’s degree in the field of electrical
engineering at Nasir al-Din University in Tehran and
working with the Ministry of Defence.826
Students were killed,arrested, imprisoned and
sentenced to death in connection with antigovernment protests in 2009. Some of these incidents
took place during student association activities or on
campus.827 Days after the disputed 2009 election,
security forces assaulted students in several
provincial towns including Shiraz, Isfahan, Tabriz,
Bandar Abbas and Mashad.828 In one incident, on 14
June 2009, around 300 riot police and Basij forces
armed with guns raided Tehran University’s dormitories, resulting in the deaths of at least five students
and 133 arrests.829 One witness told The Guardian that
police issued a warning on loudspeakers saying: ‘If
you evacuate the building, we won’t harm you.
Otherwise you will all be injured or killed.’ When the
students came out with their hands on their heads,
the police beat them with batons.830
In several cases, students or academics were
executed after being convicted on spurious charges or
confessing under duress. One charge known as
