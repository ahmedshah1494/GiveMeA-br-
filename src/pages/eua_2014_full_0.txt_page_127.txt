
and M23 forces and the activities of other armed
groups who took advantage of the security vacuum
created by the army’s focus on the M23. At least 561
incidents of looting and damage, affecting 548
primary schools and 13 secondary schools in North
and South Kivu, were reported by local protection
monitors – although the percentage damaged during
targeted attacks or military use was not specifically
indicated, and not all cases could be confirmed.646 As
of March 2013, the Education Cluster had received 133
reports of schools affected by looting and damage in
North Kivu in which the presence or activity of armed
forces or armed groups was noted, including the
Congolese Army, the FDLR, the M23 and several Mai
Mai groups.647 During attacks on two schools in HautUélé district in January 2012, 10 classrooms were set
on fire by alleged LRA elements.648

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Two incidents of attacks on students or education
personnel were reported. On 4 October 2011, seven
education workers belonging to the Banyamulenge
ethnic group were killed near Fizi, South Kivu, in an
ethnically-driven attack by Mai Mai Yakutumba
fighters while on their way to lead a one-month
teacher training programme;649 and on 13 November
2012, shots fired by soldiers and police reportedly
killed four primary school students and injured nine
others in Kantine during a student march.650

Military use of schools
There was widespread military use of schools in 2012,
particularly as temporary barracks or bases. Schools
were occupied or used by the Congolese Army as well
as the FDLR, Mai Mai groups and other militia.651 In
Katanga province, where confrontations between Mai
Mai militias and FARDC were ongoing, some 64
schools were reported to have been occupied by
armed groups as of March 2013.652 Soldiers from the
Congolese Army reportedly occupied 42 primary and
secondary schools in Minova, South Kivu, and
Bweremana, North Kivu, for varying lengths of time653
from 20 November 2012 until at least 24 December,
preventing at least 1,100 children from going to
school.654 They used chairs and desks as firewood and

looted offices and stores, seriously damaging a
majority of the schools they occupied.655

istrative buildings and the deaths of a science student
and a security guard.663

Child recruitment and sexual violence at, or en
route to or from, schools

Attacks on education in 2013

A range of armed groups and the Congolese army have
recruited children and some of the recruitment has
taken place at schools. In April 2009, schools in the
northern Masisi-Walikale border zone were
temporarily closed in response to threats of
recruitment by Mai Mai forces.656 Ongoing recruitment
of children and threats of re-recruitment, including
from schools in Masisi and Rutshuru territories in 2010
by former CNDP elements integrated within FARDC,
were also documented.657 In November, ex-CNDP
FARDC members who refused to leave North Kivu
despite government orders reportedly visited schools
and demanded lists of recently demobilized
children.658 Between 19 April and 4 May 2012, M23
rebels forcibly recruited at least 48 boys around
Kilolirwe, Kingi, Kabati and other locations on the road
to Kitchanga, in Masisi, North Kivu province, according
to Human Rights Watch; some of them were recruited
at schools or on the way to or from school.659 On 19
April 2012, near Kingi, Masisi territory, M23 forces
rounded up at least 32 male students at Mapendano
secondary school.660
At least one incident of sexual violence was perpetrated on the road from a school. On 25 June 2009, a
Congolese army colonel in South Kivu allegedly raped
a 15-year-old girl on her way back from school, and
forced her to follow him on his redeployment after he
learned she was pregnant – although she eventually
managed to escape.661

Attacks on higher education
There were two reported incidents involving higher
education. In January 2011, university students
protesting insecurity on the campus of the University
of Kinshasa, following the murders of two of their
classmates, clashed with police. The university administration reported three deaths resulting from police
gunfire, though police said there were only injuries,
and several buildings and vehicles were looted or set
on fire.662 Student protests over tuition fee increases in
April 2011 also resulted in the damage of admin-

Destruction, looting and occupation of schools664 and
the presence of unexploded ordnance in and around
schools665 continued in 2013, as did the threat of
recruitment from schools and along school routes in
eastern DRC.666 As of late September, the UN had
documented at least 49 attacks on schools and health
facilities by armed groups.667 From 15 February to 18
March, the UN verified some six attacks on schools
and hospitals during fighting in North and South Kivu
and Orientale provinces.668 In March, UNICEF reported
that 18 schools had been systematically destroyed in
Katanga province.669 A joint investigation by the
United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO)
and local authorities in the Kamango area, Beni
territory, North Kivu, found that the armed group ADF
had ransacked 11 schools in July alone, destroying
school furniture; the group had attacked at least one
school in the preceding months.670 It also found that a
FARDC integrated brigade had temporarily occupied
five schools, burning the furniture as firewood.671
During clashes between armed groups in North Kivu
on 27 September, witnesses reported the kidnapping
of dozens of children and three teachers after their
school was burned down.672
University students and police clashed on at least two
occasions, one of which reportedly resulted in
casualties.673 In March, violence broke out at the
Institut Supérieur de Développement Rural in Lubao,
where students began protesting after a regional
administrator allegedly made derogatory remarks
about them on a local television channel. The police
claimed that warning shots had been fired on the
second day of protests but a student representative
said that the police had opened fire on the protesters,
some of whom were throwing stones, and had killed
two students and wounded at least five others.674
