
Attacks on higher education
Military use and looting of Upper Nile University were
recorded during clashes between South Sudanese
government forces and a militia group in Malakal in
early 2009.1446

Attacks on education in 2013
Despite successful advocacy efforts resulting in a
number of schools being vacated, military use was
consistently documented throughout the first three
quarters of 2013.1447 Negotiations resulted in the
vacating of most schools occupied by the SPLA by the
end of 2012; however, the first quarter of 2013 saw a
rise in incidence, with the SPLA using 16 of the 18
schools occupied in Jonglei, Western Bahr el Gazal
and Lakes states by the end of March.1448 During the
month of May, two schools were newly occupied by the
SPLA in Jonglei state, though vacated shortly thereafter, and three schools were occupied and vacated by
Auxiliary Police in Eastern Equatoria state; while six
schools were vacated in Jonglei, Lakes and Western
Bahr el Gazal, seven remained occupied.1449 The
number continued to fluctuate1450 but, by the end of
September, armed forces were using at least six
schools.1451 However, on 14 August, the SPLA issued an
order prohibiting its forces from recruiting or using
children or occupying or using schools in any
manner.1452
Fighting between ethnic Murle rebels from the South
Sudan Democratic Movement/Army (SSDM/A) and the
SPLA in Pibor county, Jonglei state, resulted in the
looting and damage of schools in April and May.1453
Human Rights Watch reported the looting of at least
three schools and the destruction of classroom
materials; the majority of these actions were said to
have been carried out by the SPLA. Soldiers also
reportedly destroyed a school in the Labrab area.1454
During the capture of Boma town by SSDM/A rebels
and the subsequent recapture by the SPLA in May, part
of an NGO teacher training centre was set on fire and
all its contents taken, while a school supported by the
NGO was ransacked and destroyed.1455
At Maban refugee camp in Upper Nile state, landmines
were found behind the Darussalam School on 21
March and caused the suspension of Child Friendly
Spaces activities.1456

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

SUDAN
More than 1,000 university students were arrested,
more than 15 killed and more than 450 injured in
2009-2012, mostly in demonstrations on campus or in
education-related protests. Many of the injuries
resulted from security forces using excessive force.
There were dozens of incidents of attacks on, and
military use of, schools.1457

Context
In Sudan’s western region of Darfur, fighting between
government forces and pro-government militia and
rebels over the past decade has left 300,000 people
dead and more than two million displaced,1458 with
schools set on fire and looted and students and
teachers targeted by armed groups.1459
Sudan’s protracted civil war between the government
and southern rebels ended in 2005 with the signing of
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which paved
the way for South Sudan’s independence in July
2011.1460 However, unresolved secession issues have
led to cross-border violence, particularly in the three
disputed areas of Abyei, Blue Nile and South
Kordofan.1461
Students, teachers, schools and universities have
been targeted during decades of conflict and instability. The government exercises tight control over
higher education, appointing public university vicechancellors and determining the curriculum.1462
As of 2011, approximately 72 per cent of adults were
literate.1463 In 2009, before the secession of the South,
gross enrolment at primary level was 73 per cent1464
and 39 per cent at secondary level.1465 Tertiary gross
enrolment was 6 per cent in 2000.1466

looted, including primary and secondary schools and
a teacher training institute, in the areas of Darfur,
Abyei, Blue Nile and South Kordofan during 20092012, but again it was not specified how many were
targeted.1468
According to the UN, three instances of burning,
looting and destruction of schools occurred between
January 2009 and February 2011.1469 For example,
militia attacked a school in Tawila, North Darfur, in
September 2010, killing four children who had sought
refuge there.1470 The reported number of schools
bombed or shelled then increased between June 2011
and April 2012 as fighting intensified between the
government and the rebel Sudan People’s Liberation
Movement/Army-North (SPLM/A-N) in Blue Nile and
South Kordofan,1471 and aerial bombing of civilian
targets by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) took a
significant toll,1472 although it has not been verified
whether the schools were deliberately targeted. For
example, in August 2011, an SAF Antonov bomber
dropped four bombs on Al Masha Secondary School in
Kauda1473 and in February 2012, the SAF destroyed two
buildings of a bible school in the village of Heiban,
dropping two bombs into its compound.1474 Mortar
shelling, for which the SPLM-N claimed responsibility
and which the UN criticized as indiscriminate, also
damaged one school in Kadugli in October 2012.1475
The UN estimated that as of December 2011, 137,900
schoolchildren in South Kordofan were missing out on
education because their schools had been damaged,
destroyed or were still dangerous because explosive
remnants of past fighting remained on site, or were
being used as shelters by armed forces and IDPs.
However, it is not specified how many schools were
damaged or destroyed in targeted attacks.1476

Attacks on schools
There were different accounts of how many schools
were attacked during 2009-2012. According to Arry
Organization for Human Rights and Development, 48
schools were destroyed in attacks by government
forces in South Kordofan between April 2011 and
February 2012, but it was not specified if these were
targeted attacks.1467 Other UN, human rights and
media reports documented 12 cases of schools or
education buildings being destroyed, damaged or

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Media and human rights reports suggest that at least
29 school students, two teachers and one head
teacher were killed and another three students and a
head teacher’s assistant were wounded in attacks in
2009-2012 by rebels, soldiers or unidentified armed
men in the Darfur region, though the motives were not
known in all cases.1477
