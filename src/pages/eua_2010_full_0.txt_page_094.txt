It was the first time school examinations had been taken in university buildings and the pass rate fell to a manageable 50 per cent.In southern Thailand, there has been a strong emphasis on increasing security force levels in the troubled southern provinces and providing armed escorts for teachers. Teachers have also received weapons training and training in how to negotiate with hostage takers, and have been given permission to carry guns. Increased police patrols were placed around schools in the southernmost provinces from December 2006 onwards, and on 16 May 2007 more than 3,000 policemen were put on guard at about 1,000 government schools as the new school year began.215 But this did not stop an upsurge of attacks on schools and teachers in 2007, with June becoming one of the worst months on record for such incidents.The dramatic fall in the number of attacks on schools in 2008 coincided with a halving of violent incidents and casualties generally in the south, which has been attributed both to protection measures - for example, the Army had reportedly positioned armed soldiers and paramilitary units on school grounds216 - and a weakening of the rebels’ position in 2008. However, it should be noted that although the number of schools burned down fell from 164 in 2007 to ten in 2008,217 the number of students and education staff reported killed in southern Thailand (17) and the number of school guards/security escorts reported killed (11) remained the same in 2007 and 2008 and proportionately increased in the first half of 2009 (10 and 7 respectively).218 This suggests that with schools better protected, insurgents concentrated more on attacking teachers individually or their security details. In January 2009, Sunai Pasuk of Human Rights Watch predicted that the trend of using car bombs to cause multiple casualties, which
