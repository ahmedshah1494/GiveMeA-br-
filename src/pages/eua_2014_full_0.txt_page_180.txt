Military use of schools
According to the UN, as of February 2011, three
schools were used by the SAF in South Kordofan,
including one primary school in El Buram town which
was occupied despite the fact that pupils were
attending classes nearby.1488 Military use of schools in
El Buram by the SAF continued throughout 2011.1489

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education students, academics and
personnel
A compilation of human rights and media reports
suggests that 15 or more university students were
killed1490 and at least 479 were injured,1491 many when
police and security forces used excessive force against
students demonstrating on campus over university
policies,1492 including limits on political and cultural
activity on campus and the charging of tuition fees for
Darfuri students from which they were supposed to be
exempted by government agreement.1493
These incidents took place across the country
including in Gedaref, Kassala, Khartoum, Nyala, Port
Sudan and River Nile state. Furthermore, according to
figures compiled for this study from over 50 human
rights and media reports, at least 1,040 students1494
were arrested by security agents, the majority of them
in protests related to education or which began at, or
took place at, education institutions. Many reported
torture or intimidation during their detention.1495 Two
academics, one university staff member and a group
of researchers were also reported to have been
arrested during 2009-2012.1496 In addition, a group of
seven Southern Sudanese students was reportedly
abducted and forcibly conscripted in Khartoum by
Southern militias and taken to a training camp outside
Khartoum, but it is unclear if they were abducted at or
en route to or from campus.1497
More than half of the arrests were made during a
series of student protests and police violence that
began at the University of Khartoum in December
2011. Over the course of two months, raids on student
residences and arrests led to dozens of student
injuries and at least 552 student arrests during
protests sparked initially by the displacement
resulting from construction of the Merowe Dam.1498
