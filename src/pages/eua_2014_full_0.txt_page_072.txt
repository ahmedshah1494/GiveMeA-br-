by independent experts. The essays focus on themes critical for improving response
to, and prevention of, attacks on education: the role of communities in protecting
education, the protection of higher education and the changing of military behaviour
regarding the use of schools and universities. These pieces are intended to provide greater
depth of analysis on several dimensions of protecting education and to highlight ways
forward for strengthening the effectiveness of protective and preventive measures.
