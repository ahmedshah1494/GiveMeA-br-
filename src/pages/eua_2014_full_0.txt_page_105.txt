AFGHANISTAN
The UN reported more than 1,000 attacks on education
in 2009-2012, including schools being set on fire,
suicide bombings and remotely detonated bombs,
killings of staff, threats to staff and abductions.
Given the challenges in collecting and verifying
reports in Afghanistan, the true number may well be
significantly higher.

Context
During 2009-2012, armed opposition groups,
including the Taliban, continued to fight to regain
control of the country, which they lost in 2001 to USbacked forces.
NATO assumed responsibility for security in

anti-government groups were active, some affiliated
with the Taliban and some pursuing separate

the unpredictable activities of village militias
(arbakai) – some allied with or supported by the
government of Afghan President Karzai and some
operating independently – and the Afghan Local
Police, a village-level defence force established by
the Afghan government at the urging of the US to
defend communities from attack.396
The Taliban and other groups have for many years
attacked schools, teachers and students.397 Along

impeded access to education and in some areas
