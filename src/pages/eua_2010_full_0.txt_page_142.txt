I support the call that States should criminalize attacks on schools as war crimes in accordance with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and prosecute offenders accordingly. This must be done as a matter of course, routinely and systematically”.On 20 April 2009, the issue was formally raised by the UN Security Council when the President of the Council, in a statement concerning the 8th Annual Report of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict, urged all parties to conflict to “refrain from actions that impede children’s access to education, in particular attacks or threats of attack on school children or teachers, the use of schools for military operations, and attacks on schools that are prohibited by applicable international law”.317 He also specifically instructed all parties listed in the annexes of the Secretary-General’s report (S/2009/158) that had not already done so to prepare and implement without delay concrete time-bound action plans to halt recruitment and use of children in combat operations “and to address all other violations and abuses committed against children and undertake specific commitments and measures in this regard”.The context in which education attacks are addressedConcern about attacks on education has been addressed in a number of development and human rights agendas, but the full range of attacks has not been entirely addressed in any single one of them. Attacks on education are a threat to the achievement of all six Education for All (EFA) goals and should be a key concern of those working to achieve Education for All. Many of them occur in areas where the goals of universal primary education, gender equality and the provision of good quality education are hardest to achieve. But early childhood education facilities (EFA Goal 1) and vocational schools (EFA Goal 3) have also been targeted. And the targeting of higher education has a knock-on effect on other goals where it impinges on the education or training of future teachers.
