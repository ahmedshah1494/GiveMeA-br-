At the same time, members of armed forces and non-state actors should be provided with training and follow-up to embed knowledge of the provisions of humanitarian law regarding attacks on education.There is a case for exploring the merits of changing international law to ban the conversion of schools and other education buildings to military use. But for most attacks on education, the human rights and humanitarian instruments already exist to deal with the problem; it is rather a question of gathering the evidence and putting pressure on international and national courts to investigate more cases.At the same time, states and parties to conflict should be encouraged to take positive steps to uphold the right to education and the right to enjoy education in safety as implied by international law. To this end, the collaborative development of internationally endorsed guidelines for protecting education systems during war and insecurity would be a positive step forward.A change of mindset is needed to ensure that political, military and judicial decision-makers are required to be conscious of the need to protect education from attack, and to give weight to that consideration in the decisions they take regarding military and security operations.The starting point should be a sustained international campaign of awareness-raising and advocacy to ensure that education attacks, including attacks on higher education, are effectively monitored, investigated and addressed through the courts; and that adequate protection and recovery measures are put in place.
