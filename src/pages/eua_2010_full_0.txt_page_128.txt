Since the ascribed motive for a high number of attacks on schools in certain conflicts is their use by the military, security forces or armed opposition groups, this may be an important point to address in law.Gregory Bart, Commander, Judge Advocate General’s Corps, of the US Navy, who is serving as Chief, Operational Law and Policy, for Special Operations Command, argues that there is a strong case for proposing a change to international law to increase the protection of school buildings in line with the level of protection afforded to religious buildings and hospitals, by banning their use for military purposes altogether.302Currently, schools are no more protected than a cinema or a hotel. Yet while school protection has not been improved in law since 1907, protection of churches and hospitals in law has improved significantly to the point that their military use is banned.Bart makes the argument that conversion to military use of one school on the battlefield leads to a higher probability that commanders will think that if one building has been converted, others must have been too, which immediately puts more schools at risk of being targeted.303He therefore argues for an outright ban on military use and for the use of a recognizable symbol in order to make compliance easier. The ban would also require continuous vetting of the purposes of course curricula and research programmes that occur within an individual school building – thus potentially also prohibiting the use of schools for political programmes designed to recruit child soldiers, or for the use of university laboratories to develop weapons of war.304Broadly, apart from the lack of a ban on military use of education buildings, the problem of widespread impunity for perpetrators of attacks on education seems to result not from deficiencies in the written law but from a failure to implement such law. Human rights experts advise that international humanitarian and human right law are complete enough to empower investigation of states on almost every problem cited in Education under Attack. Education buildings and students, teachers and education personnel are covered as civilians by the Geneva Conventions to which every state is a party.305
