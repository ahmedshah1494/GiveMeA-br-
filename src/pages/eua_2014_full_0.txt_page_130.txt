place on several campuses. Twelve people were
wounded at Ain Shams University.696 Twenty-three
were injured in clashes at Zagazig University between
students or between students and residents for and
against the Muslim Brotherhood: 15 in an incident of
fighting between students697 and eight in an incident
of fighting between students and residents.698 On 20
October, 55 students were arrested after they tried to
take their protest onto the streets from the campus of
Cairo’s ancient Al-Azhar University.699
Unrest also affected schools in central Cairo. In
January, the Al-Howeiyaty Secondary School for Girls
was burned down and the Lycee Al-Horreya was set on
fire in violent clashes between demonstrators and
security forces.700
A number of Christian schools were attacked during a
wave of sectarian violence that targeted Christian
churches and property across the country – predominantly in Upper Egypt – immediately following the
events of 14 August. For example, in Minya city, the
Coptic boys’ school complex and the Saint Joseph’s
girls’ school, among other Christian buildings, were
attacked and set on fire on 14 August.701 The same day
in Bani Suef, 125 kilometres south of Cairo, a mob
looted and set fire to a Franciscan girls’ school.702
With the start of the new academic year, a number of
student supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood led
protests or called on fellow classmates to boycott
schools, rallying against what they called a ‘military
coup’. Several students were arrested, including
seven high school students in Fayyoum during a
student-led protest in September and another two
high school students in Marsa Matrouh who were
distributing flyers calling for students to boycott
school in protest.703
One Christian school teacher, Demyana Abdelnour,
was arrested in May 2013 for blasphemy and ordered
to pay the equivalent of more than 25 years of her
salary after being accused by students of expressing
disgust when speaking about Islam.704

Arbitrary arrest, ill-treatment and torture of university
students, particularly of Oromo ethnicity, were
documented, as were surveillance and intimidation of
teacher trade unionists.705

Context
Since the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary
Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of ethnic-based
parties, came to power in 1991, students – particularly
Oromo students who are actual or perceived
supporters of the insurgent Oromo Liberation Front
(OLF) or of registered Oromo political parties – have
frequently been the targets of excessive use of force by
state security, as well as arbitrary arrests and
mistreatment in detention.706
Since disputed elections in 2005, the government has
increasingly curtailed all forms of freedom of
expression, association and assembly, and arrested
members of the opposition.707
In 2008, the Ethiopian Teachers’ Association was
replaced by a pro-government union following the
killing of its deputy secretary-general, the imprisonment of other officials, and the detention and
torture of activists.708
Net primary school enrolment was estimated at 78 per
cent, while gross secondary enrolment was 36 per
cent and gross tertiary enrolment was 8 per cent
(2011). Approximately 39 per cent of adults were
literate (2007).709

Attacks on schools
One primary school was reportedly attacked in Badme
in June 2012 by the Eritrean army – seemingly in
response to Ethiopian military attacks in Eritrea.710

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
In February 2009, police shot and killed one student,
wounded another in the chest and arrested two more
during protests at Gedo Secondary School in West
Shoa zone, Oromia.711
Teacher trade unionists were subjected to surveillance
and harassment by government security agents as
