addressing the causes of conflict through legitimate
and just ways. It can also have a deterrent effect,
contributing to the prevention of future attacks164 –
although it may also be the case that conflict
continues because one or more parties does not want
to face justice.
There are a range of effective mechanisms and means
for holding perpetrators to account available at local,
national and international levels, the appropriateness
of which depend, for example, on the nature of the
perpetrator, where the perpetrator is to be held
accountable and whether or not an issue can be
addressed domestically.165 This range covers, for
example, civilian criminal trials, military trials, civil
suits, travel bans and the freezing of financial assets
for holding individual perpetrators to account in
domestic fora, and truth commissions and traditional

non-state groups. Victims may also be awarded
reparation.166
At the international level, individual perpetrators may
be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC)
or other international tribunals or have international

Rights Council, the Committee on the Rights of the
Child (CRC) and other treaty bodies,167 regional human
rights courts and commissions, or by sanctions or
other embargoes.168 States – as opposed to individual
leaders or military commanders – cannot be prosecuted criminally; therefore, holding them accountable
includes increasing the costs to their international
diplomacy through stigmatization or ‘naming and
shaming’ and by imposing punitive sanctions, where
appropriate.169
While no one has yet been charged specifically for
attacks on education facilities under the relevant
provisions of the Rome Statute by the ICC, a handful of
cases already on the Court’s docket – and one that has
been successfully prosecuted – have mentioned the
issue of attacks on schools or the effects that
recruitment of children as soldiers can have on
education.170 For example, both the closing arguments
