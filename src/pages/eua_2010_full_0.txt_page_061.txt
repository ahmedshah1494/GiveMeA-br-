The researchers are simply doing appropriate work but it has consequences for the legitimacy of the power structure that is in place. There are other cases involving the search for deeper knowledge, and the implications of such knowledge for social, cultural and political frameworks.122 For example, after presenting papers on AIDS and human sexuality, a Moroccan professor of sociology repeatedly received death threats, made both by the government, which wanted to stifle the findings, and by religious conservatives, offended by the mere subject matter of the study.123The SRF study authors conclude that there is no single motivation for attacks on academics. Multiple factors are usually involved, but what the cases have in common is that the persecuted scholar’s academic works are viewed by his or her government or by non-governmental actors as a threat. The position of academics and their work are seen as a source of power that provides them with prestige, international contacts and the ability to influence students. As Jarecki and Kaisth argue:The oppressors – whoever they may be and whatever their reasons – want to interfere with the scholar’s independence and to obtain his or her support for a specific viewpoint or, at the very least, to remain silent. The methods of oppression differ, but the goals are similar: to create an environment in which open scholarship or debate is not just discouraged but actively opposed, perhaps even in a way that threatens a scholar’s job, freedom or life.As has been true throughout history, from the Byzantine Empire through to the Nazi period and now to the persecution of academics in Iraq, silencing scholars is about gaining power and control, preventing unwanted opinions from being expressed, unwanted languages from being spoken, and an unwanted gender (women) or nationality from expressing their views.124
