bodyguards and blast-proof vehicles for high-profile
staff and trade unionists. These strategies could also
include providing armed or unarmed security forces
around or within universities, although these should
be provided in ways that recognize and enhance the
autonomy concerns unique to higher education,
whenever practical (see above).
There are a number of country-specific examples of
physical protection strategies involving university
campuses and communities. In Colombia, a Working
Group on the Human Rights of Teachers composed of
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
(OHCHR)322 and representatives from the Colombian
government and the trade union movement provided
threatened or targeted teachers, university academics
and trade union representatives with administrative
and financial support for protection measures. Special
committees were set up that studied on a case-bycase basis the type and degree of risk and the type of
ensuing protection, including armed escorts/guards,
mobile phones, bulletproof vehicles and temporary
relocation.323

academics often occur off-campus; second, attacks
that take place inside higher education buildings have
in some cases been carried out through suicide
attacks or using remotely detonated bombs, which
may make external security measures ineffective; and
third, security measures and armed responses risk
limiting or restraining the autonomy of universities,
especially when the perpetrator of aggression and
violence is the state through its security forces.325
Increasing use of university-controlled private security
guards might be a partial solution to these challenges,
at least as far as respecting autonomy concerns, but
not in all cases. Furthermore, even the best trained
private security forces will be of little use in situations
where the state itself is the source of the threat to
universities and to the perceived ‘enemies’ within
their walls.326

Promoting resilience: alternative sites and modes of
higher education provision
Flexible education provision has been tested in places
such as Belarus, Iraq, Israel/Palestine and Zimbabwe.
It implies reducing the risk of students and staff as
visible targets by removing them from the context of
traditional learning places, reducing the time they
spend in class by rescheduling lectures and providing
them with alternative learning modalities (e.g. homeschooling, community-based learning or distance
learning).

It is not clear to what extent the securitization and
militarization of educational staff and buildings may
mitigate or exacerbate attacks, and if, and in which
ways, such measures may affect learning. While a high
risk of attacks may necessitate increasing security at
and around universities, physical protection
strategies present a number of dilemmas: first,
escorting large groups of students and university
professors collectively may render these groups and
the respective guards more exposed to attacks;
second, concentrating security forces around universities may turn students or scholars into individual
targets outside the university campus; third,
enhancing infrastructure security may protect
university buildings but equally it may turn them into
‘attractive’ locations for military use by armed forces;
fourth, there is a risk that the use of self-defensive
force by education staff could be seen or interpreted
as taking an active part in the hostilities, thus turning
them into potential targets.324

In 2007, a year rife with attacks on Iraqi academics and
scholars, the Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education
allowed academics and researchers to work from
home for part of the week in order to minimize
movement around university buildings.327 While
similar measures may prove efficient in reducing the
number of fatalities, they do little to reduce death
threats or to prevent the ensuing exodus. In this
regard, more can be done with exiled academics
either to find ways through which they can still
contribute to the national education system, or to
better integrate them in the new host country, giving
them the chance to continue their work throughout the
period abroad.

Moreover, effective implementation of such strategies
in the higher education context may be difficult for
several reasons: first, attacks on students and

For example, distance learning programmes have
been developed by a number of organizations,328
enabling exiled Iraqi scholars to record lectures that
