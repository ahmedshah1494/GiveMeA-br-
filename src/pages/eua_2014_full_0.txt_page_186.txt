killings unattributed.1568 By October 2011, the number
of scholars assassinated in targeted attacks by
security forces was 10, mostly from Homs, according to
the opposition.1569

Attacks on education in 2013
As the conflict between the government of President
Bashar al-Assad and rebel groups continued into
2013, attacks persisted against Syrian schools and
universities, their students and staff. Schools were
affected by aerial attacks,1570 car bombs1571 and missile
strikes,1572 often with high numbers of victims. In
September, an incendiary bomb was dropped on the
playground of the Iqraa Institute Secondary School,
Aleppo province, killing 10 pupils and at least one
teacher and causing severe burns to 19 more
students.1573 Later that month, a fuel-air bomb landed
on a high school in Raqqa killing 15 civilians, of whom
14 were students and one was the school janitor.1574 It
has not been verified whether the schools were the
intended targets in either of these two attacks.
In higher education, two of the country’s most prestigious universities were hit by multiple explosions. Two
explosions killed at least 82 and wounded dozens
more, possibly as many as 150,1575 at Aleppo University
on the first day of mid-term examinations in
January.1576 Students and university staff were believed
to be among the dead.1577 The rebels blamed a
government air strike; the government said rebels had
attacked with rockets.1578 A mortar shell hit the café of
Damascus University’s engineering campus on 28
March, killing at least 10 students and wounding
20.1579 The government and rebels blamed each other.

THAILAND
During 2009-2012, more than 120 Buddhist and
Muslim students, teachers and education staff were
killed or wounded by insurgents in the far south, who
also did much of their recruiting in schools in 2009.
Widespread military use of schools by armed forces
and paramilitary forces made them a target for attack.

Context
Since early 2004, an insurgency by Muslim separatists
seeking autonomy in Thailand’s four southernmost
provinces – Songkhla, Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat –
has led to more than 5,000 deaths, 9,000 injuries and
human rights abuses by all sides.1580 Three of the
provinces are predominantly ethnic Malay Muslim in a
country that is 90 per cent ethnic Thai Buddhist.1581
Despite an agreement between the government of
Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and the separatist
Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) on 28 February
2013,1582 hostilities were continuing in the southern
border provinces at the end of the year.
Insurgents in the far south have carried out bombings
and shootings of security forces and civilians,
including targeted attacks against Buddhist and
Muslim teachers.1583 There have also been revenge
attacks on mosques, Islamic schools and Muslim
teashops, allegedly by Buddhist vigilantes and
security forces.1584
Elsewhere during the reporting period, Thailand was
embroiled in a bitter power struggle between the ‘Red
Shirts’, supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra who had
previously been ousted as premier by a military coup,
and the anti-Thaksin opposition ‘Yellow Shirts’ who
were supported by the military. This resulted in mass
protests and crackdowns.1585 During 2005-2011, there
was a surge in the use of lèse majesté law1586 as a
means to prevent criticism of the monarchy and to
stifle debate on reform, thus limiting academic
freedom and free speech among scholars.1587
Historically, Thai governments have used schools as a
tool to assimilate the southern population into the
Thai Buddhist mainstream. In the 1940s, the
government banned Islamic schools, Islamic attire,
the local Malay dialect, Muslim names and the
teaching of local history. Malay students were forced
