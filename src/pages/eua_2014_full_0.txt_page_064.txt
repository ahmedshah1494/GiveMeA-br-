convened by INEE and UNESCO in April 2013. INEE has
developed a Guidance Note on Conflict-Sensitive
Education206 and USAID was commissioning work on
conflict-sensitive sector planning in 2013. Protect
Education in Insecurity and Conflict (PEIC) and the
UNESCO International Institute for Educational
Planning are beginning a capacity-building project for
crisis-sensitive education.
Safety measures, including emergency drills, have
become a part of school policy in some places in an
effort to mitigate the impact of potential attacks. In
Mexico, for example, in response to crossfire in
shootouts near to schools, teachers in a number of
states were given training on how to keep their
students safe during gun battles and schools began to
hold drills.207
Aside from protection, a key problem affecting
recovery from attacks is providing continuity of
education for students affected by violence or whose
schools have been destroyed. To ensure this happens,
education authorities must develop and implement
plans which respond to current emergencies and
prepare for future ones; for example, they should
ensure that education is protected and continuous for
displaced populations – whether displaced internally
or across borders – as well as for those who remain in
their place of origin; and that regulations are in place
to guarantee the safety of rebuilt or replaced facilities
as well as the availability of temporary learning facilities in the meantime.208
UN agencies and NGOs frequently supplement
government efforts in areas of conflict by providing
temporary learning spaces for displaced school
populations, often in the form of tented classrooms,
as well as emergency education supplies.209 In
Somalia, for example, the Somali Formal Education
Network, an umbrella group for 55 schools in
Mogadishu and three other regions, helps teachers
follow communities when they are uprooted,
sometimes teaching under trees or tents. When an
area becomes dangerous, the school authorities look
for another location and move to ensure that
education continues.210
