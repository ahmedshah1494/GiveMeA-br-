
children, according to the UN, although it stressed
that this number represented only a portion of the
incidents that took place due both to difficulties in
gaining access to certain areas because of fighting
and the absence of systematic monitoring and
reporting. Most attacks were reported to have been
carried out by the Gaddafi government’s forces and
opposition forces led by the NTC.1026
A UN inter-agency assessment found that in Zlitan
between five and eight schools reportedly used for
military purposes were badly damaged and that
several schools that were allegedly being used for
military purposes were damaged by aerial
bombardment. An independent civil society factfinding mission visited a number of schools and
colleges targeted by NATO, including a number of
schools in Zlitan that it had been told were used by
pro-Gaddafi forces, but found no evidence of prior
military use.1027
In 2011, 89 schools reported unexploded ordnance on
their premises, affecting 17,800 students. This
problem continued into 2012.1028
Schools were used as polling stations during elections
to Libya’s General National Congress in July 2012,1029
which may be the reason that some were attacked by
armed militias.
The Ministry of Education reported attacks on at least
five schools that were being used as polling stations
during the elections in July 2012.1030 For instance, on 6
July 2012, a polling station in a school compound in
Benghazi was attacked by small arms fire and improvised explosives.1031

Military use of schools
According to a UN respondent, 221 schools were used
by armed groups during 2011, with a further 35 used by
the government or local administration.1032 The UN
respondent said both pro-Gaddafi forces and forces
aligned with the NTC used schools as military bases,
thus making them a target for attack.1033 At least one
school in Misrata, Al-Wahda High School, was used to
detain hundreds of prisoners and remained a
detention facility as of 2013.1034 During the revolution,
there was a pattern whereby rebels, when they
liberated areas, used schools as detention centres to

hold prisoners.1035 Schools were closed at the time.
Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) reported that
Gaddafi forces had also used an elementary school in
Tomina as a detention site where women and girls
were raped.1036

Attacks on higher education
In October 2011, forces of Libya’s interim government
seized control of two strategic areas in the city of Sirte,
at the university and at a huge construction site that
was meant to be its new campus.1037

Attacks on education in 2013
There were isolated reports of explosive devices being
placed inside or near schools1038 and fears that girls

were being abducted by armed men. On 28 September
2013, it was reported that four girls had been
abducted from outside schools in Tripoli, with at least
one incident involving armed men. Government
officials strongly denied a claim that up to 47 girls had
been taken in less than a week.1039 Nonetheless,
teachers staged a sit-in to demand increased security
outside schools.1040
