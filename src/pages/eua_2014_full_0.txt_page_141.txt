October 2013.839
In early June 2011, following the arrest of many
lecturers,840 the Baha’i Institute of Higher Education
(BIHE) was declared illegal by the Ministry of Science,
Research and Technology.841

Attacks on education in 2013
In January, three teachers were among five founder
members of the Alhavar Science and Culture Institute
who had their death sentences suspended pending
new investigations. Their sentences had followed
false confessions made after being tortured,
according to the International Campaign for Human
Rights in Iran. Alhavar members organized poetry
nights and art classes for young Arabs at a location
belonging to the education and development ministry,
but the institute was banned after organizing demonstrations opposing discrimination against Arab
people in 2005.842
Following Hassan Rouhani’s election as president,
some measures against students were eased. In
September, the Ministry of Science announced that
student activists who had been expelled from universities after 2011 could resume their studies, but those
who were banned earlier remained barred.843

IRAq
More than 100 school students and dozens of
university students and academics were killed in
2009-2012, and there were numerous direct attacks
on schools. The targeting of students, teachers and
academics continued in 2013 with shootings and
bombings.

Context
Sectarian fighting put significant pressure on Iraq’s
education system in the years following the fall of
Saddam Hussein in 2003. Hundreds of academics
were assassinated844 and the Ministry of Education
recorded 31,600 attacks against universities and
schools.845
After Saddam Hussein’s regime was toppled, Iraq
eventually fractured along sectarian lines as proBaathist forces and Islamist insurgents fought the

US-led occupying forces and Sunnis and Shias fought
each other. The levels of violence fell significantly by
2009 as a result of three main factors: US funding for
militia comprised of Sunni tribesmen who had previously fought the US and Iraqi forces,846 a surge by US
troops that pushed Islamist militants out of contested
cities and provinces, and a Shia ceasefire.847 American
combat forces withdrew from the country during 2011.
However, education continued to be affected by
violence and sectarian divisions.
Bombings remained commonplace, particularly in
central Iraq, and armed groups, including Al-Qaeda in
Iraq (AQI) and Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), continued to
carry out acts of violence targeting academics,
security forces and government buildings.848 Violence
also escalated in 2013 between Shias and Sunnis,
partly provoked by the Shia-led government’s
perceived marginalization of Sunnis, but also due to
the growing strength of Al-Qaeda and other factors.849
In addition to the direct violence against education
institutions and targeted killings of university staff,
sectarian divisions shaped the higher education
sector, putting pressure on students and faculty of
opposing groups.850 Different sects controlled
different Iraqi cities including the universities located
in them.851 There were also claims that control over
particular universities was increasingly being handed
to political parties. For instance, it was reported that
Baghdad University had been ‘allocated’ to the Islamic
Supreme Council in Iraq, Al-Mustansiriya University to
the Sadr Group, and Al-Nahrain University to the AlDawa Party.852 These groups interfered in many
aspects of university life, including admissions,
hiring, course content and physical security on
campus.853 After the appointment in 2011 of a leading
member of the pro-Shiite Islamic Dawa party, Ali alAdeeb, as Minister of Higher Education, the education
ministry fired large numbers of former Baathists from
university faculties.854 Subsequently, complaints of
sectarian bias in appointments were presented to the
United Nations Human Rights Council.855
In addition, insurgent groups demanded changes to
the curriculum or tried to deny access to education to
students from targeted groups and often responded
with violence when their demands were not met.856

Net primary enrolment in Iraq was 89 per cent
(2007),857 net secondary enrolment was 44 per cent
(2007)858 and gross tertiary enrolment was 16 per cent
(2005).859 The adult literacy rate was 79 per cent
(2011).860

Attacks on schools
There were 56 documented attacks on school
buildings during 2009-2012. Five attacks on school
buildings or facilities were documented in 2009,
seven in 2010, 29 in 2011 and at least 15 in 2012.861
Methods of attack included suicide bombings, use of
improvised explosive devices (IEDs), mortar attacks
and gunfire.862 For example, on 24 September 2012 –
the second day of the new school year – a suicide
bomber drove his car laden with explosives into AlKifah primary school in Anbar province, killing five
children and injuring six others. The blast caused
severe damage to the school building.863
In addition, IEDs planted in the vicinity of schools
impinged on access to school services: 54 incidents of
IEDs affecting schools were reported in 2011 alone.864
In some incidents, the detonation of bombs outside
schools was linked to intentional efforts to damage
them. For example, on 1 March 2012, an IED exploded
in front of a secondary school in Kirkuk and a police
search revealed a second bomb in the school.865 In
other cases, IEDs were planted to attack passing
military targets but also put students and teachers at
risk. For example, an explosive charge hidden in a
rubbish bin went off near a primary school in the AlRashidiyah neighbourhood of northern Mosul on 25
March 2009, missing its passing US patrol target and
instead killing four schoolchildren and injuring seven
more as they were leaving the school to go home.866
Militia groups also stored explosives at schools. Six
schoolchildren were killed and 28 students and
teachers wounded at the Abaa Dhar primary school for
boys in 2009 when a cache of explosives hidden
underneath the school’s rubbish dump, allegedly by
militia groups, was accidentally detonated by the
head teacher while he was burning refuse.867
Armed groups threatened several girls’ primary
schools on different occasions by planting IEDs on the
premises, attacking the schools at night and leaving
