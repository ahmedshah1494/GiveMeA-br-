are screened at universities within Iraq and to connect
in ‘real time’ with students and faculty at Iraqi universities,329 and fostering exchange between Iraqi
universities and universities abroad to improve access
and quality of higher education within Iraq.330 In
Israel/Palestine, distance learning has been used to
mitigate problems associated with university closures
and travel risks for students and academics at
Palestinian universities.331 In Zimbabwe, virtual classrooms have enabled academics in the diaspora as well
as non-Zimbabwean lecturers to deliver lectures in
areas such as health science and veterinary science to
students at the University of Zimbabwe.332 These are
fields of study in which there are staffing and teaching
capacity gaps at the university,333 as many higher
education staff have felt compelled to leave the
country.334
Other alternative sites or modes of education
provision include home schooling or communitybased learning. Following the removal of autonomy
and the repression by the Serbian state throughout
the 1990s and until the 1999 war, the education of
Kosovo Albanian children and youth was based on a
parallel schooling system that operated from the
primary to the tertiary level.335 As a political response
to increasing pressure placed by Belgrade on Kosovo
Albanian scholars and activists, the parallel ‘Albanian
University of Prishtina’ was reorganized into a
diaspora-funded system whose classes were offered
in the basements of private apartment buildings:336
such a political choice had protective implications.
There exists little comparative research on the topic of
flexible education, however, and there is little
substantive evidence on whether such a system could
work for urban-based higher education in larger
settings and in conflict areas.
Alternative learning programmes, when and where
implemented, also raise questions about the quality,
feasibility and sustainability of the education
provided as well as about relations with the formal
education system. With regard to higher education,
the lack of empirical research renders it unclear to
what extent and for how long such alternative learning
programmes can prove to be useful, how they can be
certified and what their overall impact is on the quality
of education.

Recovery measures for academics in exile: fellowships
and multiple relocations
Many of the international networks and organizations
that engage in advocacy on behalf of threatened
academics provide support for relocation to other
countries, including offering, finding or funding
temporary academic positions, as well as professional
capacity development programmes and research
fellowships.337 Clearly, much of this work provides a
vital lifeline for vulnerable and threatened academics.
But it also raises important issues related to brain
drain and the well-being of those academic communities left behind.
For any academic or scholar, the decision whether to
stay or leave is a very personal one. It reflects calculations about physical safety of the individual and her or
his family; about work prospects; and about the future
of the country in which she or he is working. The
decision to leave is rarely taken lightly, and it is often
not intended to be a ‘forever’ decision. However,
exiled academics may be more effective when safely
outside of their home countries, living in conditions
that allow them to produce academic works – and
often send them home – in a way that would otherwise
not have been possible under conditions of attack and
life-threatening insecurity.
Reversing brain drain is not impossible and a multifaceted response towards ending impunity and
increasing resources and protection for higher
education personnel would, in many cases, further
promote returns. More specifically, the risk of brain
drain could be reduced by: increasing support and
protection measures for scholars and academics
before they feel compelled to flee the country; developing particular programmes that would ease and
support their eventual reintegration while still in exile
and after they return to their home country; facilitating
increased security provision; and increasing support
from colleagues in the region and beyond to prevent
feelings of isolation.

Underground and in-exile universities
One of the few cases of entire universities relocated in
exile is the European Humanities University (EHU) in
Belarus338 which, following government efforts to
assert control over the university, relocated to
