
the post-election crisis. The UN reported a total of 477
schools destroyed, damaged, looted or used by armed
groups and military forces during this period, although
it is not clear whether they were all targeted.604
Monitoring undertaken by the Côte d’Ivoire Education
Cluster indicates that a total of 224 attacks on
education facilities in 15 education districts took place
between January and June 2011,605 with at least half
occurring in Abidjan.606 Approximately 180 schools
were pillaged and 173 were destroyed, burned down or
damaged.607 Twenty schools were attacked by bombs
and eight were left with unexploded ordnance.608 At
least 23 administrative buildings were also
attacked.609 As of July 2011, an estimated 67,000
children were prevented from accessing schooling as
a result.610
Though 97 per cent of schools reopened by late April
2011, some 140,000 previously enrolled students had
not yet returned to school by July 2011.611 Teachers
were also still absent in a number of areas, with
almost 50 per cent missing from schools in Man and
Odienné one month after the crisis.612

Attacks on school students, teachers and
education personnel
From 2009 through the post-election violence,
members of FESCI created an atmosphere of fear and
intimidation in secondary schools and universities by
injuring and sometimes killing fellow students as well
as teachers and administrators, often with impunity.613
On 26 March 2010, for example, FESCI and the
National Student Union of Côte d’Ivoire of the
Dimbokro modern high school fought pitched battles
in Dimbokro. Eight FESCI members, armed with
machetes, attacked and killed a student in the city
centre. Four FESCI members were arrested by police
and schools subsequently closed for a period.614

Military use of schools
At least 23 school premises were used by armed forces
during the crisis, including three to store weapons and
four as collective graves.615 These occupations of
schools – especially in the west of the country – were
predominantly committed by the Republican Forces of
Côte d’Ivoire (FRCI), formerly the ‘New Forces’, who
fought for President-elect Ouattara. The FRCI typically

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

used primary and secondary schools as well as adult
education centres for relatively short periods of time
when occupying one village to launch attacks on
another,616 although in September 2011 five schools in
the region of Moyen Cavally were reportedly still
occupied by FRCI elements,617 and at least one training
centre remained occupied as of December 2012 after
having become a de facto military camp.618 The UN
also identified one incident where Liberian mercenaries and pro-Gbagbo elements had employed a
school for military purposes in the Yopougon neighbourhood of Abidjan.619
Following the end of the political crisis, military use of
schools decreased dramatically, with only two
incidents verified by the UN in 2012.620 However, the
military continued to erect checkpoints near primary
schools located in Touba, Ziriglo, Toa-Zéo and Keibly,
among other towns and villages, making schoolchildren vulnerable to attack or intimidation by armed
elements.621

Attacks on higher education
Following the 2010 elections, attacks on higher
education increased as tension mounted between the
pro-Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara camps. Universities
quickly became embroiled in the conflict, with FESCI,
among others, operating alongside Gbagbo’s security
forces.622 On 30 November, for example, FESCI
members attacked pro-Ouattara students from the
University of Cocody623 campus in Abidjan, forcibly
ejecting some 50 students from their dormitories.624
A number of universities, including in Abidjan, Daloa
and Korhogo, were forced to shut down indefinitely.625
As fighting began, a university in Abidjan was transformed into an improvised military training camp for
pro-Gbagbo militia.626 Gbagbo supporters gained
control of most campuses in Abidjan.627 Hundreds of
young men received military training in schools and
university housing in 2011, typically conducted by
members of the Ivorian security forces, according to
accounts from the Abidjan neighbourhoods of
Yopougon, Abobo and Port-Bouët, the political
capital, Yamoussoukro, and the far western town of
Duékoué.628

Occupation and use of university facilities by forces on
both sides led to substantial damage, looting and
destruction. For example, in March 2011 during the
most intense period of hostilities, the University of
Abobo-Adjamé was first taken by pro-Ouattara forces,
and then by Gbagbo’s security forces.629 At least 70 per
cent of the campus was destroyed in the process,
including key academic records.630 After the postelection crisis, the Ouattara government temporarily
closed and renovated the country’s public universities, which had become hotbeds of violence and
militant politics, before reopening them in September
2012.631

Attacks on education in 2013
At the start of the 2013 academic year, at least two
university residences, Cité d’Abobo and Cité de PortBouët, were still occupied by the FRCI.632 A third, Cité
de Williamsville, had recently been vacated,633
following a government operation to restore public
and private property that had been occupied by force
during the post-election crisis.634

Attacks on schools, including widespread looting,
damage or destruction of facilities, and fear of
abduction and recruitment by armed groups
contributed to children missing out on education,
particularly in the eastern provinces.635

Context
Recurring conflict in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), exacerbated by the struggle to control
mineral resources in the east and south, has left more
than 5 million dead since 1997.636 A 2003 peace
agreement integrated many former belligerents into a
unified national army – the Congolese Army (FARDC) –
and created a power-sharing government, but conflict
continued in the east. Since then, the main protagonists have been the Congolese Army; the Hutu-led
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda
(FDLR); the Congolese Tutsi-led National Congress for
the Defence of the People (CNDP), which subsequently became a political party in 2009 and no
