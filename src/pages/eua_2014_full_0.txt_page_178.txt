In some incidents, the perpetrators appeared to be
members of armed groups. For example, a group of
armed men killed two Fur high school students from
Tournato village on their way to pay their school fees at
Kass High School on 13 December 2009.1478 Members
of a militia allegedly killed a primary school student in
Zam Zam camp in North Darfur in December 2012,
while he was studying with six classmates who
escaped unharmed.1479 In October 2011, four armed
men reportedly shot and killed the head teacher of
Shagra Eltadamoun primary school and wounded his
assistant while they were on their way to submit the
names and fees of students sitting for the national
primary examinations.1480 In one of the most serious
incidents, but not necessarily a targeted one,
suspected pro-government militia reportedly killed 18
schoolchildren when they opened fire in a market next
to the elementary school in Tabra, North Darfur, in
September 2010.1481
In other incidents, teachers and students were killed,
injured or arrested by government authorities. On 31
July 2012, at least six secondary school students, aged
16 to 18, were killed and more than 50 other people
injured during confrontations between police and
anti-government protesters during reportedly largely
peaceful demonstrations in Nyala. According to
Human Rights Watch, the protests started at the
schools and spread into the streets with protesters
burning tyres. Schools were reported to have been
closed temporarily following the incident.1482 On 1
November 2012, the National Intelligence and Security
Services (NISS) reportedly arrested and tortured a
dozen secondary school and university students in
Nyala, South Darfur. One of them received acid burns
on his hand.1483 Relatives said the victims were given
electric shocks using water and car batteries.1484 The
students were accused of stealing money from the
NISS agents1485 but their families said the real motive
for their arrest was their presumed participation in the
Nyala protests.1486
In another incident on 19 December 2012, police used
teargas and batons to disperse teachers protesting
against low wages and alleged corruption in the
Ministry of Education.1487
