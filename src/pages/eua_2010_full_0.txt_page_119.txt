This includes protecting educational institutions and the process of education, including students, teachers, academics and other education personnel. Special attention should be paid to the protection of girls, given the increased targeting of girls’ education in some countries.281In line with this, the instructions sent by the Security Council Steering Committee to the Nepal MRM Task Force define attacks on schools as “physical attacks against the buildings hosting a school including occupation, shelling, targeting for propaganda, forced closures, forced use of schools by armed groups/forces, physical assaults against school personnel, looting and robbery of school equipments and supplies, restrictions of access”.282Forced use of schools here refers to “military intervention disturbing regular learning activities: use/exploitation of the places for any purpose (station, bunker, night halt, using water taps/playground; lecture/talk programme/learning programme by armed groups; entering school premises with arms; firing at school premises, exchange of fire through school premises; presence in proximity with the building)”.Task Force member organizations are also instructed to count the number of teachers/staff killed and injured, the number of children/students killed and injured, and the combined number of threats to teachers/students.This dispels any notion that the MRM system is not intended to collect information on a wide definition of attacks on schools that includes students, teachers and education personnel as well as buildings. So why is it not happening in practice?Why education attacks are poorly reportedCurrently, the MRM Task Forces appear to be seriously underreporting the extent of attacks on education in many situations where parties are already listed for recruitment or use of child soldiers. There is little information on Thailand, for instance, minimal data from Colombia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and very little information on Somalia and Sudan.
