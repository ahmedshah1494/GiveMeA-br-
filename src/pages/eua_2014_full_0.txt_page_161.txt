long distance to the nearest school. Many who enrol
may not complete a full course of study and, for those
who do, other problems, such as teacher absenteeism
and poor facilities, impinge adversely on the quality of
their education. The nature of the curriculum and the
parallel existence of private, public, and madrassa
school systems are seen by some as contributing to
social divisions.1205 Boys from urban areas attend
school for 10 years if they come from the country’s
richest 20 per cent; poor rural girls, on the other hand,
receive an average of just one year of education.1206

Whether the intention was to target school buildings
as symbols of government authority, because of their
use as army bases or because of the education
imparted in them, or for all of these reasons, is not
documented. However, the Pakistani Taliban’s record
in Swat demonstrated that preventing girls’ education
was one of their objectives.

In primary education, net enrolment was 72 per cent;
in secondary education, it was 35 per cent and gross
enrolment in tertiary education was 8 per cent (2011).
Adult literacy was 55 per cent (2009).1207

Human rights and media reports suggest that at least
30 children were killed1215 in attacks on schools and
school transport from 2009 to 2012 and more than 97
were injured.1216 At least 138 school students and staff
were reported to have been kidnapped, of whom 122
were abducted in a single incident when armed
Taliban militants seized control of a convoy of 28
school buses transporting secondary school students
and teachers in North Waziristan, bordering
Afghanistan, and tried to take them to South
Waziristan. However, 71 of the students and nine
teachers were freed in a military operation.1217 Fortytwo students and teachers remained in custody.
Initially, the militants tried to kidnap 300 students and
30 teachers but more than half were able to escape.
The Taliban reportedly used kidnapping to fund their
operations and buy weapons.1218

Attacks on schools
In areas affected by Taliban militancy, hundreds of
schools were blown up and proponents of female
education were killed. The total number of reported
militant attacks on schools in 2009-2012 was at least
838 and could be as high as 919. Difficulties faced by
journalists and other observers working in the worst
affected areas mean that the true total could be
considerably higher.1208 The Human Rights
Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) reported 505 schools
damaged or destroyed in 2009 alone.1209
There was a strong trend for schools to be blown up at
night in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (KP) province and the
Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in the
north-west.1210 Typically, perpetrators set off small,
improvised devices remotely or with timers, rarely
causing casualties. The schools were mostly
government-run but private schools catering to higher
socio-economic groups were also affected. Madrassas
were not targeted. Pakistani Taliban groups
sometimes claimed responsibility for the attacks.1211
Daytime attacks on schools included bombings and
grenade and gun attacks; one school was shelled with
mortars two years in a row.1212
The bombing of schools was an alarmingly efficient
campaign for which few of the perpetrators have been
held to account despite hundreds of schools being
destroyed.1213 Hundreds of thousands of children were
deprived of education as a result.1214

Attacks on school students

At the start of 2009, Taliban militants were in control of
the Swat Valley in the North West Frontier province
(later renamed Khyber Pukhtunkhwa), enforcing their
hard-line interpretation of Sharia law and conducting
a violent campaign against female education. In
January 2009, they banned girls’ schooling outright,
forcing 900 schools to close or stop enrolment for
female pupils.1219 Some 120,000 girls and 8,000
female teachers stopped attending school in Swat
district.1220 Over the following months, the Pakistani
military regained control of the area but many schoolgirls and female teachers were too scared to return to
school nearly a year after the military ousted the
Taliban.1221
On 9 October 2012, Malala Yousafzai was shot, along
with two other students, Shazia Ramzan and Kainat
Riaz, on their school bus by a gunman who escaped
