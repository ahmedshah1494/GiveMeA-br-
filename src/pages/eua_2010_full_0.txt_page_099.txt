The study argues: “Education stands the strongest chance of being optimally protected if the analysis, decision-making and implementation of power of school security is decentralized to the provincial, district, and community levels, with budgetary and technical support offered by the central government”.237This was largely the approach adopted by the Ministry of Education, which established School Management Committees, Parent Teacher Associations and School Security Shuras to take charge at local level. The key is to ensure that local bodies are informed of all possible prevention and mitigation measures and of how to access support to implement those they deem appropriate for their situation, the study argues.Negotiating the re-opening of schoolsA dramatic breakthrough by the government reflects the findings that in Afghanistan, at least, attacks on education can be reduced if the community and even the Taliban are given more of a sense of ownership of education and their fears of external imposition of schools and/or alien values are addressed.When Afghanistan’s new Minister of Education, Farooq Wardak, was appointed in October 2008, he decided to address the opposition to government schools head on. For at least three years, the government had worked together with UNICEF and other agencies at local level to persuade local elders, particularly religious leaders, to drum up support for the education of girls and the establishment of community-based schools located inside people’s homes with volunteer teachers. (There are now 8,000 such schools and with better systems of training and pay to professionalize the teacher workforce.) Wardak borrowed from this idea of mobilizing local elders and religious leaders and invited tribal, religious and village leaders to generate support among local people for the re-opening of schools in areas where they had been kept closed after attacks.
