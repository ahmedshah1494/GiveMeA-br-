Research conducted on behalf of the Office of Her Highness Sheikha Mozah Bint Nasser Al-Missned of Qatar into the coverage of such attacks in the principal relevant treaties in IHRL, IHL, ICL and customary law suggests such attacks are already covered, even though the protection of education buildings is not expressly mentioned in them as thoroughly as, for example, the protection of hospitals.293 Under IHRL, which concerns the duty of states to protect rights, states do have a duty to protect enjoyment of the right to education or education systems from attack in times of armed conflict or insecurity even by private actors. In practice, it means states must take “reasonable” steps to protect students from attacks by paramilitaries, criminal gangs or non-state organized armed groups (NSOAG) at or on their way to or from school, where the attacks create a barrier to attending school.294 It also means they have a duty to take steps to overcome other obstacles to education, which could arguably include the need to repair schools after attack.295

292 The concept behind customary international law is that a state is bound by a norm of conduct even when it has not given its sovereign consent through ratification of a treaty, and even though it strongly disagrees that the alleged norm is customary law. That norm of conduct is established simply by general practice or the words and behaviour of states. Although there can be disputes over whether a particular standard of conduct has become a binding rule of law through custom, the two basic rules applying to the protection of education systems - no targeting of civilians or civilian objects and no excessive collateral damage - are among the most firmly established customary norms in IHL.
