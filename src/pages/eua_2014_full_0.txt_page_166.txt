killing the head teacher and wounding three adults
and six children attending a prize-giving ceremony in
March.1283 Another head teacher, who ran a private
school, was shot dead in Karachi in May.1284 At least
two schools designated to be used as polling stations
in 11 May elections in Balochistan were bombed.1285
In higher education, clashes continued between rival
armed student political groups1286 and there were
direct attacks on the institutions themselves,
including the detonation of one kilogramme of explosives packed with ball bearings in the conference hall
of the University of Peshawar’s Institute of Islamic and
Arabic Studies on 3 January, which injured five
students.1287 In the most serious incident, on 15 June, a
coordinated attack was launched against the Sardar
Bahaddur Khan Women’s University in Quetta and the
hospital ward where the casualties were taken. A
bomb exploded on a bus at the campus killing 14
female students and wounding 19. Ninety minutes
later, two suicide attackers and between two and 10
gunmen attacked the Bolan Medical Clinic, destroying
the casualty department and operating theatre and
killing 11, including two senior doctors and the Quetta
Deputy Police Commissioner, who had come to offer
security. Seventeen were wounded. The BBC reported
that the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi militant group, which has
carried out many attacks against Shia Muslims, was
responsible,1288 but said the attack may have been
targeting women in general rather than Shias, as the
university is the sole all-women university in
Balochistan.1289

THe PHILIPPINeS
There were killings and abductions of teachers,
bombing and shelling of schools and universities, with
some incidents related to their use as polling stations.
The armed forces continued to use numerous schools
for military purposes in breach of Philippines’ law.1290

Context
Two main conflicts in the Philippines have led to intermittent violence. In the communist insurgency, the
New People’s Army is fighting the government with the
aim of creating a socialist state; and in the Moro
conflict, concentrated in the south, militant groups,
including the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and
the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), are
fighting for self-rule. Civilians have been targeted via
bombings, kidnappings, and the forced recruitment
and use of children in fighting forces. Thousands have
been killed and hundreds of thousands more
displaced.
The Abu Sayyaf Group, which began as an Islamic
separatist group but has also become involved in
banditry and other crimes, remains active in parts of
the southern Philippines. In Mindanao, in the
southern Philippines, rival clan disputes and a proliferation of criminal activities have compounded the
pattern of violence in the region.1291
Recurrent attacks on education in Mindanao and other
parts of the country have disrupted schooling for
many, causing fear among students, teachers and
parents and inflicting damage on learning facilities.1292
The UN verified some 43 incidents countrywide
involving damage, destruction or occupation of
education facilities, placement of landmines and
unexploded ordnance near schools, and violence or
threats of violence against teachers and students from
2010 to 2012; and 92 more incidents were recorded
but could not be verified due to geographic and
human resource constraints.1293 Collectively, these 135
incidents were estimated to have affected some 8,757
students.1294
Net primary enrolment was 88 per cent,1295 net
secondary enrolment was 62 per cent1296 and gross
tertiary enrolment was 28 per cent (2009).1297 The
adult literacy rate was 95 per cent (2008).1298
