
and sentencing submission by the Prosecution in the
first case at the ICC, against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo
from the DRC, as well as several submissions during
the reparations phase, included references to the
impact that the crime of child recruitment had on
education.171 In the case investigated against Sudan’s
President, Omar al-Bashir, with respect to atrocities in
Darfur, he has been charged with multiple attacks on
the civilian population of Darfur that took place from
March 2003 to 14 July 2008 as part of the counterinsurgency campaign. These attacks included the
bombing of schools where a large proportion of
victims were children.172
The deterrent effect of the Rome Statute against
criminal violations during armed conflict that
constitute attacks on education would be enhanced if
ICC investigations were carried out with a view to
bringing charges against high-profile leaders who are
alleged to have issued orders to attack schools or kill
teachers or students for going to school.
UN human rights treaty bodies and other international
human rights mechanisms have also, in several cases,
begun to include attacks on education in their observations, calling on states to address the impacts of
attacks that violate the right to education and to hold
perpetrators to account.173 The CRC – the treaty body
established under the Convention on the Rights of the
Child which requires signatories to submit reports
every five years for review upon which recommendations for enhancing protections are then made174 – is
one treaty body that has made recommendations
regarding attacks on schools and military use to
several countries. For example, in 2013 it issued
concluding observations on the second to fourth
periodic reports of Israel, which expressed concern
over a range of attacks on schools and students as
well as severe classroom shortages and restrictions on
freedom of movement that impinge on access to
education for some Palestinian children.175
In addition, there are a handful of examples of
domestic accountability mechanisms that have been
used in response to attacks on school buildings or
military use of schools. For example, in India, where
security forces used more than 129 schools during
2010 alone,176 the Supreme Court issued a ruling

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

ordering the forces out.177 In general, however, considerably less is known at present regarding local or
national investigations and prosecutions for violations committed against students, education staff and
education facilities. A study published by Conflict
Dynamics International in 2011 suggests that nationallevel mechanisms have real potential to contribute to
improved accountability, but that most do not prioritize children affected by armed conflict. Technical
capacity and funding are also lacking.178 Therefore,
there is a need to encourage and support countries to
provide these requirements.

from school or lining the road to and from school with
security forces, as well as issuing firearms licenses for
teachers to carry weapons as a means of self-defence
en route to and from school.181 In response to
extortion-related kidnap threats issued to schools in
Mexico, municipal authorities in 2009 dispatched
hundreds of police cadets to patrol the targeted
school surroundings,182 while a local governmentcreated programme in Acapulco, called ‘Safe School’,
increased security personnel in and around the
schools in 2011 and installed alarm buttons in school
buildings.183

While encouraging steps have been taken to increase
accountability for attacks, these are relatively few
when compared with the number of violations
documented by this study alone. Advocacy to
strengthen accountability and reduce impunity for
perpetrators who commit violations of law that
constitute attacks on education remains a pressing
need at both international and national levels. To be
better able to draw lessons and address gaps, more
information is also needed regarding the enforcement
of national legislation and the use of domestic
accountability mechanisms.

Although an elevated risk of attack or a general
security situation may warrant the use of physical
protection measures in some cases, these measures
can have unintended negative consequences that
need to be considered carefully. Reinforcing school
infrastructure may make it more attractive for military
use, for example. Furthermore, the presence of
guards, police or other armed personnel, when they
are themselves the intended targets of violence, can
put students and teachers at increased risk of
attack.184

Enhancing security on the ground

A variety of negotiated responses to attacks have been
attempted, in particular to military use of schools. In
some cases, negotiations have been conducted by
local communities or community leaders with armed
groups or government forces; in others, they have
been undertaken by government officials, depending
on the context and nature of attacks. Negotiations
have involved dialogue and consensus-building
among parties to the conflict and education stakeholders around the types of behaviour that are
permissible on school grounds, the negative impact of
military use, the politicization of schools or the
content of the curriculum. Agreements may declare a
ban on weapons within a defined area, prohibit
political propaganda on school grounds, restrict the
military use of schools or order the vacating of schools
by armed groups or security forces, establish codes of
conduct for military and armed groups, or dictate other
terms relevant locally.185

Many different protection measures have been used in
high-risk areas to shield potential targets, minimize
damage from attacks or provide means of selfdefence.179 These have included assigning armed or
unarmed guards to education institutions, establishing checkpoints near schools, reinforcing school
infrastructure such as building walls around school
perimeters, making housing available for students or
personnel near or on campus, providing a protective
presence or escorts to accompany students or
teachers en route to and from schools, offering safer
modes of transportation and arming teachers.
For example, in Iraq, in response to child abductions
and recruitment, the Ministry of Education instructed
schools to take precautions and security patrols and
checkpoints around schools were increased.180 In
Thailand, the government – due in part to teacher
trade union demands – has for a long time emphasized the use of hard protection measures such as
providing military escorts for teachers travelling to and
