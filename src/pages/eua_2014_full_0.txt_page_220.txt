Initial figures are drawn from the Reports of the Secretary-General on Children
and Armed Conflict 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013. The figure 542 derives from 509
attacks in 2011 and 2012 reported by a UN respondent plus 17 schools reported
destroyed in 2009 and 16 reported used for military purposes in the UNSG CAC
report; and the “many more” refers to an additional figure of 311 schools hit by
mortar shells and crossfire (43% of Sa’ada schools in 2010 – of which there were
725), without specifying how many of those were targeted and how many were
caught in crossfire. The Secretary-General’s report did not specify a number of
attacks on schools in 2010.
