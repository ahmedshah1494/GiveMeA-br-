threatening messages. In some incidents, schools or
students were targeted because of the ethnicity or
religious affiliation of the majority of the students,
particularly in areas such as Kirkuk, Salahaddin and
Baghdad.868

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
During 2009-2012, some 106 school students were
killed, 200 injured and 22 abducted; however, the
number of attacks on education was greatly reduced
compared to earlier years.869
Sectarian groups attacked students and teachers, in
many cases apparently due to their status as students
or teachers.
Although a UN respondent reported no school student
or teacher victims in 2009,870 there was one media
report of three female students wounded in an armed
attack in western Mosul, on 25 May 2009, when an
unknown gunman opened fire on them as they left
their school in the Tamouz neighbourhood.871
According to a UN respondent, in 2010, 49 school
students were killed, 26 injured and five abducted in
attacks on education.872 The UN Assistance Mission in
Iraq (UNAMI) separately reported that more than 10
school teachers and university professors were assassinated in 2010 in Baghdad, Kirkuk, Mosul, Al Kut
(Wassit governorate), Al Anbar and Diyala, although it
did not indicate how many of the ten were teachers.
The motives for many of the killings were not known.873
In 2011, 37 students were killed, 33 students injured,
and 13 students abducted, according to a UN
respondent.874 Twenty-seven school personnel or
education officials were killed or injured in incidents
that included IEDs and direct shooting, mostly in
Baghdad, Kirkuk, Ninewa, Salahaddin and Anbar. In
all these cases, armed groups, including Al-Qaeda in
Iraq and ISI, were responsible.875 For instance, on 11
December 2011, a bomb attached to a car carrying a
Ministry of Education official in Baghdad’s northern
Shaab district exploded, killing him.876 The same day,
a bomb attached to a teacher’s car injured him when it
detonated in the town of Muqdadiya.877
In 2012, 69 students were killed, 167 injured and four
abducted, according to a UN respondent.878 For
