here were attacks on education in at least 70 countries during the reporting
period, 2009-2013. This section of the study profiles the 30 countries where
there was a pattern of such attacks during the four years from 2009 to 2012
and also includes information on key incidents in 2013.

The data presented here are based on reports from different sources and generally
not on primary research, and therefore cannot be considered fully verified. The
authors have cross-checked these reports as far as possible. The country profiles
should be seen as an informed collation and distillation of published reports, which
the reader may investigate further according to his or her specific needs.
