In the Philippines, codes of conduct developed collaboratively have been used to encourage armed groups
and government forces to protect and promote
children’s right to education and the human rights of
teachers and other education personnel. They are
asked to sign up to morally binding commitments to
abide by the codes. According to a case study of LIZOP
at a school in Maguindanao province, this process
opened space for dialogue among the community and
other stakeholders on how to better protect and
ensure the continuity of schooling for their children,
and provided ‘an opportunity for actors in conflict to
become actors in building learning spaces that are
safe and secure’, with members of armed groups
involved in both agreeing and signing the LIZOP declaration.193
Concerns regarding negotiation include potential risks
to the mediator and representatives of the parties
involved in the dialogue in dealing with armed nonstate groups; whether to use local or international
mediators and how they will be perceived by the
parties in the negotiations; whether to hold talks in
private or publicly; and how far to compromise on
education policy and curriculum for short-term
security gains without undermining the quality of, or
access to, education in future.

Community responses
The limited amount of research that has been carried
out on the subject supports the view of some international agencies and NGOs that responses initiated
by communities may have a key role to play in
protecting schools.194 Communities can be involved in
all of the types of response discussed in this study and
contribute to protection in a range of ways. These may
include the involvement of school management
committees in protecting schools, students and
teachers; the establishment of school defence
committees; the involvement of communities in the
construction, maintenance and protection of schools
including as night-watchmen or security guards; the
use of parents and other community members as
student and teacher escorts or a protective presence;
and the development of community alert systems,
community-based schooling, and community-led
protests, negotiations and monitoring.
