It also places obligations on non-state armed groups not to recruit or use children in hostilities.In 2008, reports of under-18s being recruited to state anti-insurgency groups in Chhattisgarh were widespread, according to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers Global Report 2008.One report said estimates assume 80,000 children are participating directly or indirectly in the conflict, with allegedly 12,000 minors being used by the Salwa Judum and many of the 4,200 SPOs recruited by the Chhattisgarh government suspected to be under 18, according to the Forum for Fact-Finding Documentation and Advocacy.176 Identifying their age is made difficult by lack of birth registration documents.In 2006, Asian Centre for Human Rights (ACHR) investigators interviewed nine minor girls in Bangapal relief camp, inside the premises of Bangapal Police Station, Chhattisgarh, who were recruited as SPOs. They told ACHR they were being given training in fighting tactics, including operation of guns and intelligence.177In the Naxalite conflict, many children are recruited by Maoists from school either under false pretences, without parental consent, or by force.“Rebels are conducting a massive drive for child soldiers in their forested hideouts in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region, which is close to Andhra Pradesh,” said Inspector General Girdhari Nayak of Chhattisgarh’s anti-Maoist police operation in May 2008.178“It’s a forced recruitment. Rebels are carrying away children without their parents’ consent and are training them to handle even sophisticated weapons and use them for attacks on civilians and police installations.
