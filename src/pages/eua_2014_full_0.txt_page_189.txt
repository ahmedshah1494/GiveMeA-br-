
exploded at the entrance of Batu Mitrapap 66 School
in Bacho district, Narathiwat province. The explosion
injured two school directors.1605

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
At least 121 Buddhist and Muslim students, teachers,
school officials and janitors were killed or wounded
during 2009-2012, according to UN figures.1606 At least
32 students and ten teachers and education
personnel were killed or injured in targeted attacks in
2009.1607 In 2010, at least two students and 12
teachers and education personnel were killed and
another five students and six teachers or education
personnel were injured.1608 At least 31 government
teachers and education personnel and one student
were killed in the southern border provinces in 2011,
and at least five teachers and three students were
wounded.1609 In 2012, the UN reported a spike of
violence in the final quarter of that year, with six
teachers killed and eight injured.1610
The vast majority of teachers and other education
personnel killed have been Thai Buddhists, but ethnic
Malay Muslim teachers at government schools and
Islamic school administrators were also targeted.1611
Many teachers requested transfers out of the southern
region due to continued insecurity.1612
Many of the teachers who were assassinated were
killed while travelling to or from work.1613 For example,
Natthapol Janae, a primary school teacher at Nikhom
Pattana Park Tai School in Bannang Sata district, Yala,
was shot dead on 19 May 2009 as he travelled to
school via motorcycle. Janae was ambushed by five
attackers on motorcycles, six kilometres from the
school.1614 In another case, a Bango Yuebang school
teacher, Samrit Panthadet, was shot in Kapho as he
returned home from school on 8 February 2010 and
gunmen burned his body.1615
Teachers who joined convoys as part of teacher-escort
programmes were not spared. On 2 June 2009,
suspected Muslim insurgents, disguised as
government soldiers, attacked a pick-up truck carrying
six teachers home from schools in Ja Nae district,
Narathiwat province. The men forced the truck to stop
at a fake roadblock set up by other gunmen in their

group. One Buddhist Thai teacher was shot dead and
three were wounded including Atcharapon Tehpsor
who was eight months pregnant. She died on her way
to hospital.1616 A more typical tactic was the detonation
of roadside bombs by mobile phone as security
convoys carrying teachers passed by, wounding or
killing both teachers and security personnel.1617
Some teachers were killed in ambushes on school
grounds. For example, on 11 December 2012, five men
wearing camouflage, some of them carrying assault
rifles, invaded the canteen of Ban Ba Ngo School in
Mayo district, Pattani. They shot dead two Buddhist
teachers after isolating them from five Muslim
teachers. At one point, the school’s Buddhist head
teacher tried to hide behind one of the Muslim
teachers, but he was still shot at close range. The other
Buddhist teacher was also shot dead.1618 According to
insurgent sources, this attack was in retaliation for an
alleged Buddhist vigilante attack on a Muslim teashop
in Narathiwath’s Ra Ngae district earlier that day.1619
Attacks on teachers often forced school closures in
response. For instance, after the head teacher of the
Tha Kam Cham School in Nong Chik district, Pattani
province, was killed in November 2012, the
Confederation of Teachers of Southern Border
Provinces closed 332 schools in the region for 10
days.1620 As a result of the 11 December 2012 killings,
the Confederation closed 1,300 government schools
serving more than 200,000 students in Pattani, Yala,
and Narathiwat provinces. The Confederation
additionally closed four districts of Songkhla for
another two days.1621
Other education personnel, such as teacher assistants and janitors, have also been targeted by
separatist insurgents. For example, a Muslim teacher
assistant at Ban Budee School in Pattani’s Yaring
district was shot dead by insurgents while returning
home on his motorcycle in Pattani’s Mayo district on
26 May 2013.1622 On 11 June 2013, a janitor at Ban Than
Mali School in Yala’s Betong district was shot dead by
insurgents as he was riding his motorcycle back
home.1623
Generally, students were not targeted, but sometimes
they were casualties. On 27 September 2011, for
instance, two students were wounded by shrapnel

when a roadside bomb hit their school bus while
being escorted by a military vehicle in Narathiwat’s
Yee Ngor district. Police believed that insurgents
intended the bomb to hit soldiers escorting the
students.1624

Military use of schools
To accommodate the additional military and paramilitary forces that the Thai government deployed in the
southern provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala,
camps were established inside school buildings and
compounds. Security forces occupied at least 79
schools in 2010,1625 and continued to use schools as
barracks and bases for at least the next year.1626 In
2011, reacting to domestic and international concerns,
the army reportedly ordered security units to stop
using government schools as barracks.1627
Military outposts at schools were targeted for attack,
putting the schools at risk. On 18 March 2011, ethnic
Malay Muslim insurgents attacked an outpost of the
Pattani Task Force 21 at a school in Yarang district,
killing one soldier. Attackers climbed over the fence of
Sano Pitthayakhom School in Tambon and opened fire
at the operations base of the 3rd Rifle Platoon of the
8023rd Infantry Company; they fled after soldiers
returned fire.1628 The military base at Ban Langsad
School in Tambon Ka Sor was attacked by suspected
insurgents on 6 December 2012. M-79 grenade explosions damaged the school wall.1629 Grenades were
also used in June 2012 to attack a school in
Krongpinang district during a security briefing in the
schoolyard; three soldiers were killed.1630
The presence of security forces in schools made
schools a target for attack and in some cases caused
parents to keep their children at home.1631 For
instance, local people removed children from Ban
Klong Chang elementary school, Pattani, after 30
Rangers established a camp in the back of the school
compound in 2010. Parents feared that the presence
of soldiers would increase the risk of attack, and staff
and students complained of overcrowding, inability to
use school latrines and the poor behaviour of
soldiers.1632
Security forces also conducted raids in search of
suspected insurgents and weapons at Islamic
