Schools were attacked in numerous locations. By early
2013, up to 1,000 schools had allegedly been used as
detention or torture centres and 2,445 were reported
damaged or destroyed, although it is not known how
many were targeted. Attacks on universities caused
very heavy casualties.1531

Context
Tensions rose in Syria beginning in March 2011. Some
of the first protests were sparked by the arrest and
torture of 15 boys who painted revolutionary slogans
on their school wall. After security forces killed several
protesters, more took to the streets, calling for
President Bashar al-Assad to step down.1532 By July
2011, hundreds of thousands of people were demonstrating across the country.1533 Security forces clamped
down, targeting specific groups, including schoolchildren and students. During 2011 and 2012, the
government gradually lost control of parts of the
country to the Free Syrian Army and other groups
including the Al-Nusra Front. According to the Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights, continuing conflict had
left more than 125,000 people dead by December
2013.1534 Bombings, killings, targeted attacks, arbitrary
arrests, torture, abductions and sexual violence led to
large-scale displacement of people and an unfolding
humanitarian disaster.1535
Education was hit hard by the war. Net primary
enrolment in 2011, the year the conflict began, was 93
per cent,1536 net secondary enrolment was 68 per
cent,1537 gross tertiary enrolment was 26 per cent1538
and adult literacy was 84 per cent.1539 The UN reported
in April 2013 that an estimated 2,445 of the country’s
22,000 schools were damaged or destroyed and 1,889
were being used as IDP shelters instead of for educational purposes.1540 Some 69 of 118 UNRWA schools for
Palestinian refugees were also closed.1541 A report by
the Syrian Network for Human Rights, based in
London, said 450 schools had been completely
destroyed.1542 By September 2013, almost two million
children aged 6 to 15 had dropped out of school
because of conflict and displacement.1543
The Assad regime kept tight control over the education
system. The Ba’ath party had a security unit

monitoring student activities at every university.
Students had no right to form an association, join a
protest or speak out in public; and university appointments were controlled by the Ba’ath party.1544 The
Syrian government prevented teachers from
expressing ideas contrary to government policy and
prohibited the teaching of the Kurdish language.1545

Attacks on schools
In reports by media and human rights sources,
including video evidence and eyewitness accounts of
individual attacks on schools, details were given of at
least 10 incidents of schools being destroyed or
partially destroyed in attacks in 2012.1546 The schools
were attacked by forces on both sides of the
conflict,1547 with some being hit by rockets and others
by shelling or air strikes. The UN Commission of
Inquiry on Syria (15 July 2012 to 15 January 2013)
documented government attacks on more than 17
schools in its 5 February 2013 report and noted that in
some cases anti-government forces were present at
the schools at the time of attack.1548
Although it is hard to determine from reports how
many of the destroyed and damaged schools were
specifically targeted, there is evidence that some were
deliberately attacked. The UN reported that
government forces looted and set fire to schools on
several occasions in 2011 in retribution for student
protests.1549 Human Rights Watch reported in mid-2013
that Syrian armed forces launched ground and air
attacks on schools that were not being used by
combatants. It said that Syrian forces fired on schools
while classes were going on inside them, using
automatic weapons and tanks, and Syrian fighter jets
and helicopters dropped bombs and incendiary
weapons on school buildings when no opposition
forces were in or near them, according to witnesses.1550
In its 2013 report Safe no more: Students and schools
under attack in Syria, Human Rights Watch reported
that one 14-year-old girl called Salma and fellow
students in Dael, Daraa governorate, hid under their
desks for protection when a tank entered their school
and sprayed the walls with machine gun fire in an
incident which took place between 19 July and 18
August 2012. Video footage viewed by arms experts at
Human Rights Watch appeared to support her account

of the attack. A soldier who defected from the Syrian
army reported that he saw a plane and a tank attack
Shaba’a High School in the suburbs of Damascus on
the first day of the school year in September 2012,
causing serious damage and injuring students.
Human Rights Watch also documented an airstrike in
Al-Bab, Aleppo governorate, on 4 November 2012, in
which four bombs struck the school while it was
hosting a civilian council, killing the head of the
council. Another witness reported that seven bombs
dropped by MiG fighters hit the playground in Ghaleb
Radi school, Quseir, Homs governorate, on 3
December 2012, releasing white smoke. Video footage
suggested they were incendiary bombs.1551

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Schoolchildren were frequently killed when schools
were targeted for attack or were damaged as a result of
collateral damage: in 2012, nine were killed in their
schoolyard in an alleged cluster bomb attack on Deir
al-Asafir,1552 and nine students and a teacher were
killed in a mortar attack on Al-Batiha school,
Damascus for example.1553
Students were arrested, detained, tortured and killed
for their participation in protests that took place in
schools.1554 Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that
security forces entered schools in Daraa, Homs and
the Damascus suburbs to collect intelligence on
students and their families, or they employed school
staff to conduct interrogations.1555 Security forces and
pro-government militias used excessive force and
even gunfire against peaceful demonstrations at three
schools, according to Human Rights Watch.1556
The UN received information that in May 2012
government forces allegedly raided the local primary
school in As Safira, Aleppo governorate, taking
hostage 30 boys and 25 girls between 10 and 13 years
of age. The forces used the children as human shields
by walking them in front of their forces to clear out a
local Free Syrian Army unit that had recently gained
control of the town.1557
UN figures suggest that by the end of February 2013, a
total of 167 education personnel, including 69
teachers, were reported to have been killed, although
it is not clear how many were targeted for attack.1558
