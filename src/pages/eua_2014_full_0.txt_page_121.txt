By comparison, FECODE’s figures were much higher:
more than 3,000 teachers reported threats against
them in 2011 and 2,000 reported threats between
January and September 2012.545
Teachers may be targeted for a number of reasons.
Some teachers in remote areas, where armed nonstate groups are strong and schools are the only
visible presence of the state, are accused by illegal
armed groups of collaborating with the enemy.
Teachers have also been targeted for playing an
important social and leadership role in the
community. Armed groups have threatened teachers
for trying to lead community efforts to protect children
from sexual violence and child recruitment and other
efforts that challenge the groups’ activities.546
Teacher murders can prompt wider community instability. According to the UN, in June 2009, an entire
indigenous community was forced to flee their homes
in Arauca province after suspected members of the
FARC shot a teacher from their village in front of his
pupils. In Cauca in 2010, the FARC allegedly killed two
teachers and then threatened all the teachers in one
rural area of that department, forcing all teachers to

flee the area and leaving 320 children without
schooling.547

threatened or because one of their classmates was
killed, according to the Ombudsman.555

According to ENS, 305 unionized teachers suffered
forced displacement in 2009-2012.548

In 2010, the government strengthened protections for
teachers at risk of violence by a decree offering such
teachers ‘provisional status’ so that they could
relocate rapidly while they waited for police to carry
out a risk assessment. A year later, another decree
added another teacher trade union representative to
the ‘Threatened Teachers’ Committee’ in territories
that had more than 5,000 teachers, and the period of
provisional status was increased from three to six
months in cases where the police could not complete
their investigation in time.549
According to a report by the National Ministry of
Education, of the 600 teaching staff who reported
receiving death threats in 2011, 38 left the country,
282 were given temporary transfers and 38 were transferred permanently.550
The International Trade Union Confederation reported
that on 9 September 2010, Segundo Salvador Forero, a
member of the teachers’ trade union EDUCAL, was
killed in Anserma, Caldas, after the local education
ministry rejected a request made to them by his union
to grant him ‘threatened person’ status, which would
have given him the right to transfer to a safe
location.551
Paramilitary successor groups and affiliated criminal
gangs also attacked students on their way to and from
school. In Medellín, the Ombudsman registered the
murder of 11 students while they were going to or
returning from school in 2009 and four more in
2010.552 These killings occurred almost exclusively in
the violence-wracked poor neighbourhoods known as
‘comunas’553 where criminal gangs, which often acted
as local franchises of paramilitary successor groups,
fought for territorial control.554 In 2011, the
Ombudsman’s Office declared that 23 schools in
Medellín were at risk from armed groups because they
were situated on the invisible boundaries between
gang territories, according to UNHCR. That same year
in Medellín, 965 students transferred from, or simply
dropped out of, six education institutions after being

Colombia is one of the few nations that explicitly limits
or prohibits the use of schools and other education
facilities by their armed forces.556 Nonetheless, there
continued to be reports of security forces using
schools during the reporting period. The UN reported
serious concerns over the occupation of schools by
national security forces in the departments of
Antioquia, Arauca, Cauca, Córdoba and Norte de
Santander in 2010,557 and by the Colombian National
Army in those same departments plus Huila, Nariño
and Valle de Cauca in 2011.558
The ICRC recorded 75 cases of occupation of school
facilities by all armed actors from 2009 to 2012.559
On 2 June 2012, the FARC attacked a police outpost
located on the grounds of the Chilví Education
Institution, Nariño department, according to CINEP, a
Colombian human rights organization.560 The police
reportedly left their outpost, which was constructed
out of wood, and fled to the neighbouring school,
which was made of brick. In the firefight, about 70 per
cent of the school was damaged, according to CINEP.
Public concerns had previously been raised about the
risks involved in locating a police station close to the
civilian population. CINEP reported that the police had
stayed years longer than the originally agreed three
months and the Tumaco Secretary of Education had
specifically asked for the station to be relocated. After
the attack, students had to be moved to schools in
neighbouring areas and teachers did not want to teach
in Chilví due to the lack of security. A day after the
school rector asked the police to relocate during a
public meeting, he received death threats and was
forced to flee, according to CINEP.561
The 2012 Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict
report described police in Putumayo using schools as
a base for operations against guerrillas or failing to
comply with a requirement to stay at least 200 metres
away from schools. Police presence led to schools
being attacked by guerrillas; and police reportedly
sexually harassed female pupils and stole school food
