But the reverse is also true: if schools are repeatedly attacked and it becomes too dangerous for teachers to turn up to teach or for parents to send students to them, a keystone of stability is removed from the community - increasing the likelihood of displacement and putting children at risk from other dangers. It is in the interests of all concerned with child protection to campaign for the protection of schools and other places of learning.As Nicholas Burnett, then UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education, told the UN General Assembly in March 2009: “Clearly, we will not reach the Millennium Development Goals and Education for All goals as long as children living in fragile and adverse circumstances are excluded from school or only have access to limited and low-quality learning opportunities. We will not reach these goals when students themselves, their teachers and other education personnel are victims of threats and attacks. “But the issue goes well beyond numbers. It is about how the denial of education in fact perpetuates a cycle of violence and exclusion, how we deprive children, youth and adults of the knowledge, skills and values they need to build a better and more peaceful future”.185More monitoring and research neededMore research is needed on the long-term impact of attacks on students’ education, teachers’ ability to teach, and academics’ ability to carry on researching, including the impact of being targets or witnesses of brutal attacks such as shootings, rape or torture. Currently, most reporting on the impact of attacks on education is related purely to the numbers of schools closed, but little is said about the continuing effects on the quality of education or rates of enrolment and retention after they have re-opened. More of this kind of information would help build a wider case for the need to protect education systems and better orient responses to attacks.
