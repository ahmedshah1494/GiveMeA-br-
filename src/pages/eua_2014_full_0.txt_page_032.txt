Scale and nature of attacks on education

T

housands of targeted attacks on education have been reported
across dozens of countries and spanning most regions of the world
in the period covered by this study, 2009-2013.

The vast majority of these attacks involved either the bombing, shelling
or burning of schools or universities, or the killing, injury, kidnapping,
abduction or arbitrary arrest of students, teachers and academics. Some
were carried out by armed forces or security forces, others by armed
non-state groups or in some cases by armed criminal groups.
In addition, education facilities were used as bases, barracks or
detention centres by armed groups and armed forces. Moreover, there
was significant evidence of children being recruited for use as
combatants from schools and some instances of sexual violence by
military forces and armed groups against students and teachers.
