Some 15 landmines and unexploded ordnance were
found within the vicinity of schools from 2010 to 2012,
and six grenade attacks and three instances of mortar
shelling were also recorded.1305 At least 17 schools
were partially damaged and three schools destroyed
in the same period.1306

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
From 2010 to 2012, there was a pattern of attacking
teachers. At least 14 teachers were killed, three
injured, five threatened or harassed, six abducted and
one arbitrarily detained.1307 Three students were
abducted.1308
In a number of cases, teachers or students were
abducted, sometimes for ransom, by the Abu Sayyaf
Group.1309 For example, in October 2009, Abu Sayyaf
gunmen allegedly abducted an elementary school
head teacher from a passenger jeep transporting a
group of teachers and later beheaded him after his
family refused to pay the requested ransom.1310
In other incidents there was an observable pattern of
targeting teachers in connection with their duty as
election poll officers.1311 During 2010, some 11 teachers
were killed,1312 with a significant number of attacks
recorded at the height of the presidential election in
May 2010 – although attacks were still taking place in
and outside of school premises months later, perpetrated mostly by unidentified assailants – and during
local elections.1313 For example, a few days after the 25
October 2010 barangay (village) elections, the head
teacher of Datu Gumbay Elementary School in
Maguindanao was shot dead by unidentified gunmen;
weeks later, on 2 December 2010, a lone gunman
killed another teacher at the same school while he
was standing near the gate in sight of students and
other teachers.1314

Military use of schools
The practice of military use of schools is explicitly
banned in the Philippines, both under national legislation and military policy.1315 Despite this, at least 56
incidents of military use of schools, mostly involving
use by government armed forces, were recorded by the
UN from 2010 to 2012.1316 School buildings, particularly in remote areas, offered convenient protection
