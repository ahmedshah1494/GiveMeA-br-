Attacks on academics undermine the quality of higher education provision and restrict its contribution to economic, political and human development by inhibiting the growth of ideas, destroying intellectual capital and deterring bright minds from pursuing an academic career.Attacks on education targets, therefore, are not just attacks on civilians and civilian buildings. They are an attack on the right to education, including the right to a good-quality education; an attack on academic freedom; an attack on stability; an attack on development; and an attack on democracy.We already know that there are strong correlations between fragility and low access and achievement in primary education – for instance, over half of children not in primary school worldwide are found in conflict-affected countries.9 Just as the World Bank has argued that provision of education, particularly for girls, is the single most effective intervention that countries can make to improve human development, the reverse is also true: attacks on primary schools, particularly girls’ primary schools, and the degradation of the education system that results from persistent attacks and fear of attacks, are particularly damaging for development. The prevention of attacks on education and the strengthening of the right to education at all levels, therefore, can also be viewed as important contributions to tackling conditions of fragility.However, currently, monitoring and reporting pays too little attention to the impact of attacks on education systems, such as the negative effects on teacher retention and recruitment, or the detrimental narrowing of the education vision, placing limits on the knowledge or content that can be researched, taught or applied.Prevention and protection measuresEducation under Attack (2007) reported on a range of measures taken to prevent or increase resilience to attacks, including posting armed guards at schools, providing armed escorts for transport to or from school, encouraging community defence of
