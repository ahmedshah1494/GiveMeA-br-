
However, in all of these countries, the
exact number of attacks in which
education facilities, students or staff were
targeted is unclear, due to the lack of
specificity of available information.
Some individual incidents resulted in
large numbers of casualties. For instance,
in Somalia in October 2011, an AlShabaab suicide bomber exploded a
truck filled with drums of fuel outside a
compound in Mogadishu housing the
education ministry and other ministries,
killing 100 or more people, many of whom
were students and parents. In a prerecorded message, the bomber reportedly
said he was targeting the students, who
were due to gather at the Ministry of
Education to obtain examination results
needed for scholarships to study abroad.
The reported motives for targeting
schools, students, teachers and other
education staff include the desire to:
• destroy symbols of government
control or demonstrate control over
an area by an anti-government
group;
• block the education of girls, or any
type of education perceived to teach
or impose alien religious or cultural
values, biased history or an
unfamiliar language of instruction;
• restrict teacher trade union activity
and academic freedom;
• abduct children for use as
combatants, sex slaves or logistical
support in military operations, or
abduct students and teachers for
ransom; or
• seize schools and universities for use as barracks and
bases or firing positions, or attack schools because they
are being used for these purposes by opposing forces.
