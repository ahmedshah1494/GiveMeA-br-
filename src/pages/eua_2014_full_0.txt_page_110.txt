
‘spreading western propaganda and poisoning the
minds of the young generation in Afghanistan’.446
According to news reports, the threats and bombing
caused 120 students to drop out.447
The use of suicide bombers extended to at least one
university as well as to schools. On 7 February 2012,
government officials reported that a blast from a
suicide bomb car attack close to the entrance to
Kandahar University killed at least seven people and
also wounded 23.448
In another case, Sunni students attacked Shiite
students at Kabul University in late November 2012 to
prevent them from observing Ashura – the festival of
the martyrdom of Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet
Muhammad – inside a dormitory mosque. Around 100
students were involved in the fighting, university
buildings were damaged, one student was killed after
being thrown out of a window and up to 30 were
wounded.449

Attacks on education in 2013
According to the Ministry of Education, approximately
100 teachers and education officials were killed
between January and August, some of them by assassination, others in roadside bombings and
crossfire.450 In June, in one incident with heavy
casualties, a suicide bomber on a motorcycle
detonated his explosives close to a boys’ high school
in Chamkani district, at going home time when ISAF
and Afghan Local Police forces were passing, killing 10
students and injuring 15 others.451 The UN said tactics
such as suicide bombings close to schools could be
war crimes.452 In other incidents, UNAMA reported that
a student was abducted and killed in May in Bak
district, Khost province, after chanting an anti-Taliban
song, and an education officer was shot and injured
while visiting schools to monitor them in Kunar
province in June;453 and in August, a teacher’s home in
the Sangin district of Helmand province was targeted –
an explosive device was set off outside the house of a
teacher who had previously received threats to leave
his job, killing two children.454 Three education administrators were also shot dead in Parwan, Uruzgan and
Herat provinces by unknown gunmen in August.455
Schools and universities were threatened,456 set on
fire457 or used as bases for combat,458 and there were

continuing reports of alleged mass poisonings of
schoolgirls,459 although there was no verification of
whether poisoning took place.
In May, the Taliban forced schools in Zabul province to
close after the local government banned motorcycles
as a security measure because they were being used
in assassinations.460

BAHRAIN
Following the outbreak of anti-government protests in
2011, students, teachers and academics were arrested
from schools and universities and teacher association
leaders were imprisoned. There were many incidents of
sectarian threats and intimidation in schools and
universities that year.461

Context
The majority of attacks on education in Bahrain
occurred amid the unrest that erupted in February and
March 2011 during a wave of protests inspired by the
uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But repercussions
continued into 2012.
In February 2011, authorities forcibly suppressed
peaceful anti-government and pro-democracy
protests. Seven people were killed and many more
were wounded.462 Members of both the majority Shia
community, which has called for a greater voice in the
government, and the Sunni community joined the
demonstrations for political reforms.463 After weeks of
protests, the government declared a three-month
state of emergency and called in Saudi military forces
to help keep order.464 Sporadic protests against the
government continued into 2013, and the country’s
human rights situation reportedly deteriorated.465
Political tensions were reflected in schools and universities. In early 2011, thousands of teachers went on
strike, first demanding respect for human rights and
later calling for better security;466 thousands of
students participated in protests, including in and
around their schools; police entered school facilities
to arrest students; and political and sectarian clashes
involving students and parents occurred on school
grounds.467

Political activities were prohibited at universities and
schools, as well as at other government buildings and
public institutions.468 Teacher trade unions, along with
other government sector trade unions, were banned in
2003 by the Civil Service Bureau Act 1.469 The Ministry
of Social Development dissolved the Bahrain Teachers
Association, formed as a response to the ban on
unions, in April 2011, alleging that it had incited
teachers and students to strike.470
Net primary enrolment was 98 per cent (2006),471 net
secondary enrolment was 93 per cent (2011) and gross
tertiary enrolment was 37 per cent (2011).472 The adult
literacy rate was 92 per cent (2010).473

Attacks on schools
The Ministry of Education reported a pattern of attacks
on government schools, typically involving damage to
facilities by setting them on fire or throwing Molotov
cocktails. Approximately 200 schools were reportedly
attacked between September 2011 and October
2013.474 However, it was not clear whether these were
acts of political protest or, rather, vandalism.

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
During 2011, police arrested students and teachers for
their political activities from school facilities,
including from at least 15 girls’ schools, according to
the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR).475 In July
2011, BCHR said it had received reports of arrests of 66
teachers, predominantly women, although it said the
actual number may have been higher.476 In December
2012, BCHR reported that police stopped a school bus
carrying boys from an elementary and an intermediate
school and held them at a police station until their
parents came to sign a pledge.477 According to BCHR,
some students and teachers arrested from schools
reported that police interrogated and beat them, and
threatened them with sexual assault.478
There were also reports of numerous suspensions and
sackings, as well as salary deductions, of teachers
and Bahrain Teacher Association members who were
accused of having taken part in the February 2011 antigovernment protests. On 15 June 2011, for example,
the independent newspaper Al-Wasat reported that
the Al-Ahd Al-Zaher School had sacked eight teachers
