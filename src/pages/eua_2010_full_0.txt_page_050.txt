This is also a challenge in some countries not affected by open conflict, where attacks are perpetrated by or with the tacit approval of repressive regimes.Despite the challenges of data collection and analysis, more detailed information about attackers and their motives has emerged in some of the worst-affected countries over the past few years. The types of attacker vary in different situations, and may include groups of armed civilians, civilians mobilized by armed groups, militants, armed groups, armed criminal gangs, state-backed paramilitaries, state armed forces, state police and/or state security forces.
