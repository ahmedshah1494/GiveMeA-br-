Lithuania with support from over a dozen governments, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs,
foundations, corporations and individuals.339 Many of
the staff and students still live in Belarus and endure
regular harassment from the Belarus authorities when
travelling between university and home. A similar
example was the establishment in Syria of the private
International University for Science and Technology in
2005.340 The institution was founded by a group of
Iraqi professors who, having fled Iraq following
targeted assassinations of academics, pooled their
savings, opened the first English-language university
(with both Iraqi and Syrian students enrolled) and
recruited other Iraqi professors from Iraq.341 The
university was still operational in 2013, although it had
had to adapt to conditions of insecurity resulting from
the Syrian conflict.342

innovative teaching-learning environment, courses
that were initially delivered by correspondence are
now provided through on-line communication
technologies. In addition to the on-line platform, an
affiliated global faculty that involves hundreds of
accredited professors from universities outside Iran
assists BIHE as researchers, teachers and
consultants.344 However, in 2012 the Special
Rapporteur on Iran reported that in June 2011 the
Ministry of Science and Technology had declared the
activities of the institute illegal and that all diplomas
and degrees issued by it had no legal validity; and
noted that some individuals affiliated to the university

Community protection
Mechanisms of protecting education from attack
based on community engagement have been tested in
rural settings and for primary and secondary
education, while to date there have been no examples
of their effectiveness for higher education. For higher
education institutions and academic communities,
mainly located in urban areas, the potential of using
