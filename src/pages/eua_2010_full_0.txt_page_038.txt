Currently, violations against students, staff, personnel and buildings in higher education are publicized via newsfeeds, media stories and rescue appeals, published by the Network for Education and Academic Rights (NEAR), the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (CARA), the Scholarship Rescue Fund (SRF), the Scholars at Risk Network, Education International (EI) and other similar networks. But very few data are collected, the exception being the useful survey of SRF applicants and grantees by the Institute of International Education, SRF’s host organization (although the study’s coverage is limited as previously mentioned).56All reporting is restricted by obstacles such as access to areas of conflict, manpower, threats against journalists, trade unionists or NGO workers and the time and resources it takes to interview victims and witnesses.For instance, the OCHA news website, IRIN News, which exists to provide humanitarian organizations with daily news about political, security and humanitarian developments to help them coordinate their work, provides frequent reports on attacks on education but only in certain countries. Set up in 1996 after the Rwandan genocide, it has expanded from providing twice daily bulletins to multi-media reporting including web stories, podcasts and documentary films. However, it does not cover Latin America and, although its reporting of attacks on education is strong in Afghanistan and Pakistan, it remains weak in other key countries, such as Thailand.“Coverage of attacks on schools or education has happened by chance,” says Antony Morland, a senior IRIN editor. “If a story on attacks on schools comes in we’ll cover it, but it is not something we would necessarily set out to cover”.
