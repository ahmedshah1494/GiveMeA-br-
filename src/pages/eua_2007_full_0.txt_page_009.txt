The nature of attacks The types of attack carried out vary from sophisticated military-style operations such as the Beslan school tragedy, probably the worst single attack on an educational institution in recent history, to bombings, assassinations, detention and torture, and threats of violence. On 1 September 2004, the ﬁ rst day of term, 32 or more armed militants stormed Number One School in the Russian town of Beslan, North Ossetia. They held its 900 pupils and around 400 parents and teachers hostage for three days in the gymnasium, which was rigged with trip wires and explosives. The hostages were told if any mobile phones were found on any individual they and the three people nearest to them would be shot. When gunﬁ re broke out between Russian security forces and the hostage takers, 344 hostages were killed including 186 children. An estimated 700 civilians and 30 special forces personnel were wounded. Chechen warlord Shami Basayev, who has since been killed, claimed responsibility for the storming of the school. Russian sources suspected Al Qaeda involvement in the attack.The Beslan tragedy captured the news headlines across the world and large-scale attacks, such as the explosions in Iraqi universities, receive international press attention, but many incidents involving individual assassinations are not reported in the media outside the country in which they take place. Yet for teachers in those places, a threat or just the knowledge that militants are out there, watching and waiting for an opportunity to shoot or stab them, can be as signiﬁ cant a deterrent to carrying on their work as an explosion that kills dozens of students and staff. The types of attack can be divided into groups according to the tactics involved and the intended effect, as described below.
