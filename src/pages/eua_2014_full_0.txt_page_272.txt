GCPEA: Why evidence is important, what we know and how to learn more
(GCPEA, 2011). See also studies prepared on programmatic responses, which
primarily remain at the level of case study/examples and description of components – though suggest lessons for programme design and implementation, for
example: GCPEA, Study on Field-based Programmatic Measures to Protect
Education from Attack (New York: December 2011); and Christine Groneman,

Attack,” in Protecting Education from Attack: A State-of-the-Art Review (Paris:

The first violation for which a party could be listed was recruitment and use of
children by armed forces and armed groups. Subsequent Security Council resolutions added other violations: killing and maiming of children and rape and other
grave sexual violence against children (SC Resolution 1882) and attacks on
schools and hospitals (SC Resolution 1998). Abduction and denial of humanitarian access do not lead to listing, but are monitored in all situations.
UN Security Council Resolution 1998 (2011).
