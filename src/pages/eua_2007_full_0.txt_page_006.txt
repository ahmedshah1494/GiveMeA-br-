in the previous three years. At least 112 teachers had been injured.22 In the three southernmost provinces, 16 students died and 58 were injured in the same period.23 Another 36 schools were burned down in the ﬁ rst four months of 2007.24Zimbabwe: Between 2001 and 2002, there were at least 238 human rights violations against teachers, including 34 cases of torture, 75 incidents of assault, 13 death threats, 45 school closures and 6 abductions. In addition, 2 ministers were alleged to have issued death threats against student leaders and their principals for supporting the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.25 In 2000, there were allegations of rape and molestation of female teachers and severe beatings of teachers and headmasters due to their political allegiance.26Worldwide, the overwhelming majority of attacks on schools are carried out by local forces, but one source claims there have been 314 attacks on schools by “international militarized terrorists” in recent years against schools in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, Israel, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Russian Federation, Timor-Leste and Turkey.27  Scarcity and quality of dataThere is no single, exhaustive global database dedicated to monitoring violent attacks on education workers, students and institutions that can provide a reliable picture of the number of attacks. In addition, some of the available country-speciﬁ c information is supplied by Ministries of Education, which may not have a neutral role in the conﬂ ict. There is one global database of terrorist acts that includes educational institutions as one of the categories of targets of attack, but its ﬁ gures for the countries worst-affected by attacks on education are very signiﬁ cantly lower than those supplied by education ministries, NGOs and press reports.
