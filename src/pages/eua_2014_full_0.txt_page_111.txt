and, on 27 June, the Unions Federation in Bahrain
reported that the Ministry of Education had sacked 60
employees, mostly teachers.479
On 25 September 2011, a military court sentenced the
president of the Bahrain Teachers Association, Mahdi
Abu Deeb, to 10 years in prison on charges of using his
position within the BTA to call for a strike by teachers,
halting the educational process, inciting hatred of the
regime and attempting to overthrow the ruling system
by force, possessing pamphlets and disseminating
fabricated stories and information. Abu Deeb alleged
that he endured torture in pre-trial detention.480 His
deputy, Jailila al-Salmaan, received a three-year
sentence. In October 2012, a court of appeal reduced
their sentences to five years and six months respectively.481

converging on the school. Some students and parents
threatened the headmistress and staff and threw
rocks at a school building in which they had taken
refuge. Riot control forces were sent to disperse the
crowds. Eight students were injured and received
medical care. Other schools reported similar incidents

The BICI report also documented complaints of abuse
against members of the Sunni community at schools
because of their religious affiliation or refusal to join
protests.483 In total, the BICI report identified ‘approximately 83’ incidents of sectarian threats in
universities and schools, including verbal abuse and
harassment of students as well as physical assaults.484

Attacks on higher education
Most incidents affecting higher education occurred
during, or as a result of, the protests of February and
March 2011 in which university students and
professors participated. According to the president of
the University of Bahrain, on 13 March 2011, 55
individuals were treated in intensive care after clashes
at the campus between government supporters and
