Research could usefully include deeper investigation of some of the more difficult issues informing commandersâ€™ decisions to carry out military operations, such as what constitutes excessive collateral damage to schools; or government decisions about police and security operations against suspected subversion by students, academics and trade unionists, such as whether the action impinges unreasonably on human rights, academic freedom and the right to education.Engagement with media outlets, editors and journalists is required to promote understanding of the issues and coverage of violations. The aim should be to generate a groundswell of informed international opinion to ensure that political, military and judicial decision-makers are required to be conscious of the need to protect education from attack and give more weight to that consideration in the decisions they take.
