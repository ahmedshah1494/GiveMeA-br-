The 2009 UNESCO expert seminar in Paris was told by legal experts with experience of advising combat commanders that the key to preventing violations is good discipline; effective training of troops; and an effective system of listening to complaints, reporting all suspected violations and investigating and prosecuting where there is a case to answer. Under the Geneva Convention, soldiers must be trained in the implementation of international law not just when they are recruited but annually, before deployment, and in the theatre of war. They must be informed, for instance, that collateral damage cannot be excessive in relation to the military advantage to be gained and that their decisions will be judged on the expected impact on civilians. They must carry with them cards which effectively communicate the rules of engagement. At the same time, the advice on operational law given to commanders on the battlefield is critical. Military legal experts argue that there is a need to better stigmatize the use of schools for military purposes if attacks by national and international armed forces are to be reduced.Making education work for peaceOne way to reduce the risk of schools becoming targets in the first place is to ensure that education plays its part in building peace, before, during or after conflict. As mentioned in Education under Attack (2007), a blueprint for this exists already in the form of the 1966 Recommendation Concerning the Status of Teachers, which in paragraph 3 states:Education from the earliest school years should be directed to the all-round development of the human personality and to the spiritual, moral, social, cultural and economic progress of the community, as well as to the inculcation of deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; within the framework of these values the utmost importance should be attached to the contribution to be made by education to peace and to understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations and among racial or religious groups.
