Attacks on education in 2013
The PTUZ reported that teachers were intimidated with
threats of physical harm into supporting a particular
political party during the parliamentary and presidential elections in July. The union said that in

Mashonaland West, the teachers were forced to
withdraw their membership from the PTUZ as the
organization complained about the harassment of
teachers.1799 The Zimbabwe Election Support Network
reported as an illustrative critical incident during the
voting process the fact that some known teachers in
Chimanimani East, Manicaland, asked for assistance
