The only piece of qualitative evidence assessing an outcome of community
participation identified during the research is given in CARE’s research report on
Afghanistan. This states that 65% of respondents from communities with a
school that was not attacked said the community requested the building of the
school, but slightly fewer (56%) respondents from villages where the school was
attacked said the same. Hence the probability of attack may be somewhat
reduced when communities themselves request or want the school - although a
9% difference is not statistically significant enough to enable broad conclusions.
