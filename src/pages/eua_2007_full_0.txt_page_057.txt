comply, they faced punishment, possibly death. But if they acceded to the demands, they were treated as Maoists sympathizers by the security forces.78Displacement is another common cause of children’s schooling being suspended or permanently ended, because there is no school to go to in their new surroundings or because they must spend their time trying to earn a living in order to survive.79 In Colombia, some 1.35 million children have lost all access to education through forced displacement.80Watchlist on Children in Armed Conﬂ ict reported in 2004 that 500,000 school-age children in Colombia do not enrol in elementary school each year and about 3 million 14- to 17-year-olds are not in school. The attendance rate of children aged 12 to 17 dropped by two percentage points between 1997 and 1999. UNICEF and Save the Children have attributed the growing drop-out rate to a combination of poor-quality education and the disruptive effects of the armed conﬂ ict.Becoming a child soldier keeps hundreds of thousands of children out of school worldwide and some volunteer precisely because they do not have access to school and see becoming a soldier as the only means to escape poverty and secure survival. A study of former child soldiers in Colombia found that 40 per cent could not read or write.81Disruption is the most common side-effect of attacks, wearing away at the effectiveness of the school system. Amnesty International reported in 2005 that, in many areas of Nepal, schools had been entirely shut down due to the destruction of premises, lack of teachers, military operations and threats by the CPN-M. In other areas, children were getting fewer than 100 days schooling a year because of Maoist activities, such as ‘political education’ sessions.82 In Thailand, the constant assassinations have forced large groups of between 100 and 1,000 schools to close for a week at a time because teachers are fearful of going to work or pupils are traumatized in the aftermath of attacks. The insecurity has led to a high turnover of teachers and a lowering of the quality of school education compared to other parts of the country, according to UNESCO Bangkok. Universities
