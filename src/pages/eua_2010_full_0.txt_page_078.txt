They do not ask anyone how old they are. Even 14-year-olds can become SPOs if the police want them to. There are boys and girls who hold rifles and the rifles are bigger than them”.180 According to Human Rights Watch, the auxiliary police have used children as guards, while Salwa Judum has reportedly used them in violent raids on local villages.One journalist who visited the site of a Naxalite attack on a police outpost in Rani Bodli in March 2007, in which up to 55 police including 27 SPOs were killed, told Human Rights Watch he saw the bodies of many SPOs and estimated that around ten appeared to be under 18 years old.181Nobody knows how many children are being used to gather intelligence, act as guards, make and plant landmines and explosives, and fight in the war between Maoist rebels and the security forces of Chhattisgarh State. But there is a strong case for better monitoring to gauge the scale of the problem.
