
Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
From 2009 to 2012, attacks on students, teachers and
other education staff included killings, torture,
assaults, illegal detention and threats of violence.
Some 122 teachers were killed and 300 injured in
2009-2012, nearly all of them during the 2011 protests
or during conflict between tribes and Houthi rebels in
Jawf governorate in the far north, according to the
Yemeni Teachers’ Syndicate (YTS).1717 It is not known
how many of those attacks were targeted.
In addition, the YTS documented other abuses by
Houthi rebels, mostly in Sa’ada governorate, also in
the north, as well as by state armed forces or security
forces. Abuses by Houthi forces included four teachers
allegedly killed for sectarian reasons, 29 teachers
imprisoned, 11 tortured, 11 kidnapped and six
assaulted.Alleged abuses by state forces included
two teachers disappeared during protests; other
teachers received death threats or were illegally
detained or harassed.1718
The YTS said there was evidence that some abuses by
Houthi rebels were carried out for sectarian reasons,
against those who rejected their beliefs, as threats to
teachers from Houthi rebels issued by text messages
indicated.1719 Muhammad Al-Shamiri said Houthi
rebels went into schools and ordered teachers and
students to chant Houthi slogans and use pro-Shiite
texts, and attacked them and closed down the school
if they refused.1720 The Houthis follow Zaidism, a
moderate school of Shia Islam.
Houthi rebels targeted leading education figures in
2012. Al-Shamiri himself, as Director of Sa’ada
Education Office, received death threats and was
forced to flee the city in February 2012. A threat
received by text message stated: ‘Your death is very
close’. He knew of no reason why he was threatened
other than as a teacher who managed and supervised
other teachers, at a time when teachers were being
targeted. Al-Shamiri understood the threats to have
come from Houthi forces who had threatened him
before.1721 Ebrahim Dhaiban, the YTS chairman in
Sa’ada, was illegally detained by Houthi rebels on his
way home from work in late November 2012.1722

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Military use of schools
According to the UN Secretary-General’s annual
reports on children and armed conflict, in 2009-2012
at least 52 schools were used for military purposes,
with 16 used as bases and 36 used for storage of
military weapons by combatants.1723 Most of the
incidents documented by the UN were related either to
the Houthi conflict or the activities of opposing
military forces during the anti-government protests.
However, information provided by a UN respondent
and other sources suggests that the total number of
schools used for military purposes may have been
much higher than the figures appearing in the UN
Secretary-General’s reports.
In 2009, during fighting between Houthi rebels and
Yemeni forces in Sa’ada governorate and neighbouring areas, there were reports that dozens of
schools were being used by combatants from both
sides.1724 This equated to most schools in the affected
areas and halted the education of some 30,000
primary and secondary schoolchildren.1725 The
presence of combatants also resulted in some schools
being attacked and 17 were completely destroyed. The
Ministry of Education had to cancel the school year in
the affected areas, Sa’ada and Harf Sufyan.1726
In October 2011, Reuters, the international news
agency, reported that at least 50 schools in Sana’a had
closed because of the unrest that followed protests for
reform. Of these, the majority were reportedly seized
by armed gunmen.1727 Similarly, UNICEF documented
that armed forces and armed groups had occupied at
least 54 schools in 2011.1728
In addition, Seyaj Organization for Child Protection
reported that, during March-October 2011, schools
came under direct attack after they were used by prouprising tribal fighters, pro-former regime forces and
Al-Qaeda-linked militants as fighting positions, places
of military training and ammunition stores.1729
In 2012, according to a UN respondent, at least 58
schools were occupied; six of them in Hasaba, a
district of Sana’a, were used by armed forces and
various armed groups, and 52 were used by Ansar AlSahria in Abyan for about four months until mid-June,
when the group lost control over the governorate.

According to the source, the majority of these schools
were heavily contaminated with explosives and
became targets of attacks by opposing forces.1730 The
UN Secretary-General reported that during an
offensive in the first half of 2012, Yemeni armed forces
allegedly shelled schools in Abyan that were occupied
by Ansar Al-Sharia. At least 19 schools were either
partially or totally destroyed.1731 A similar incident was
reported in Aden.1732
In March 2012, Human Rights Watch visited five
schools in Sana’a that were partially occupied, two
that were completely occupied, seven that had previously been fully or partially occupied and one that was
closed because of the military presence near the
school. By early September, all of the schools had
been cleared. The occupiers were: the Al-Ahmar tribal
militia, the renegade First Armoured Division and the
Yemeni army.1733 It found that two buildings at Asma’a
School, a girls’ school near Change Square, were
being used by between 70 and 100 soldiers of the First
Armoured Division, who were living on the campus.
They first moved onto the school campus in July 2011
and did not leave until August 2012, despite classes
continuing at the school. At another school, Al-Faaruq
School, close to the President’s residence in Sana’a,
Presidential Guards set up sandbag and concrete fortifications on the roof and used them as observation
points and firing positions, despite classes for 2,000
children continuing at the school. Both of these
schools were subsequently vacated.1734
There were reports in December 2012 of Houthi forces
taking over an unknown number of schools in Al-Saif
and Haja for use as detention facilities.1735

Child recruitment from schools
The general phenomenon of recruitment of children by
armed forces and armed groups in education settings
has been documented but the numbers of children
recruited have not been established, nor have the
numbers recruited from schools or en route to or from
school.
Shawthab Organization, a local child rights NGO,
reported Houthis handing out leaflets to schoolchildren encouraging them to join the armed group
Shabab al-Mo’mineem (Believing Youth).1736 They said
