In ‘night letters’ delivered to her doorstep, followed by threatening phone calls, the Taliban has repeatedly warned her to close the 7,000-pupil school on the grounds that girls should not leave their home. It is a common tactic of ultra-conservative elements, who use propaganda, coercion and violence to spread their inﬂ uence. In one of the most brutal incidents, in Zabul province, the headmaster of a co-educational school was beheaded.Niyazi has received no help from the government or security forces and is only able to keep the school open by hiring security staff to guard the school. “I have not told the teachers about the threats and also hid the second letter from my own family,” she told IRIN News.51Her plight is not unusual. In July 2006, Human Rights Watch warned that escalating attacks by the Taliban and other armed groups on teachers, students and schools in Afghanistan were shutting down schools and depriving another generation of an education, and the main target is girls.In the LA Times,52 Zama Coursen-Neff, a senior Human Rights Watch researcher, recounted the story of Setarah, a teacher in the ﬁ rst girls’ school in her village, whose students found a landmine in their classroom, hidden under a bag.
