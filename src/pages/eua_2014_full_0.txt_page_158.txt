Then, in January 2012, Boko Haram leader Abubakar
Shekau was reported to have issued a chilling threat
via an internet audio message stating: ‘You have
primary schools as well, you have secondary schools
and universities and we will start bombing them….
That is what we will do.’ This caused fear among
parents, many of whom were reported to have stopped
sending their children to school.1162 From January to
March 2012, Boko Haram claimed responsibility for
the damage and destruction of 12 schools in and
around Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, citing
retribution for state security force attacks on a
Tsangaya (Koranic) school and the arrest of Koranic
students in January 2012.1163 At least 5,000 children
were unable to attend classes as a result,1164 in a state
with one of the country’s lowest primary school attendance rates.1165 The methods of attack varied and
included burning buildings and using explosives. All
of the attacks occurred at night or in the early morning
when schools were vacant, and in several cases,
watchmen were tied up or held at gunpoint to prevent
their intervention. The schools targeted were either
non-denominational or provided both Western and
Islamic education.1166
In May 2012, suspected Boko Haram militants used
explosives and gunfire to attack two primary schools
in the northern city of Kano.1167 From September to
November 2012, according to media sources, at least
a dozen more primary and secondary schools in
Maiduguri, Damaturu, Zaria, Barkin Ladi, Potiskum
and Fika were set on fire or damaged by explosives,
including in attacks by Boko Haram, but also during
fighting between Boko Haram and state security
forces, or in clashes between Muslims and
Christians.1168

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Prior to 2011, and in contrast with attacks on schools,
most attacks on school students, teachers and
personnel involved kidnapping for ransom and
appeared to be carried out for criminal rather than
political objectives. For example, in Abia state, in the
south-east, a school bus carrying 15 nursery and
primary school students to the Abayi International
School was hijacked in September 2010.1169 Similarly,
