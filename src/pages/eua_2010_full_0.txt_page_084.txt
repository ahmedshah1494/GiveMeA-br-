But there is also useful information concerning Zimbabwe, Somalia, Nepal, Georgia and the occupied Palestinian territory.In Afghanistan, 670 schools remained closed in March 2009, according to UNICEF, denying education to 170,000 pupils in a country where half the school-age population was out of school. Girls’ education was disproportionately targeted for attack, with the detrimental effect of undermining efforts to improve their already seriously disadvantaged position through school closures and reductions in student and staff attendance rates. The CARE research reported that three per cent of male teachers and seven per cent of female teachers were said by survey interviewees to have decreased their attendance after attacks.186 Only 35 per cent of the 5.7 million pupils enrolled in schools in Afghanistan in 2008-2009 were girls. In July 2009 in Afghanistan, 400 schools remained closed, mainly in the south, due to insecurity, the Ministry of Education said. The improvement reflected the success of an attempt to negotiate the re-opening of closed schools (see Section 8: Protection and prevention measures).Following a recorded 98 school incidents between 1 May and 24 June 2009 in Afghanistan, including direct attacks by small arms and rockets, the burning down of schools and death threats, Ann Veneman, head of UNICEF, said attacks on education “pull the country backwards and threaten the significant advances made in education and child health in recent years.“Even where they do not suffer directly from the violence, when children are not allowed to feel safe at school or travelling to school, their education and their prospects suffer, and the futures of their families and their communities are undermined,” she said.187In Thailand, 300 teachers requested relocation from one of the affected provinces in 2008. Press reports have indicated that hundreds of schools may close for days or weeks at a time following an attack on a school, teachers or soldiers guarding teachers
