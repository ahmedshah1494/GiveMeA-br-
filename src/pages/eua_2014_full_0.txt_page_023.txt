his study, undertaken under the auspices of GCPEA,
builds on the previous two Education under Attack
studies published by UNESCO in 2007 and 2010. For
the first time, it is published by a group of agencies
rather than a single agency. Since the last study, which
covered incidents up to mid-2009, there has been a huge
increase in reporting of attacks and, in turn, our
understanding of the problem and what should be done
about it has deepened and changed. This study aims to
make new information and analysis available, extensively
covering four years of attacks on education from January
2009 to December 2012, but also including information on
key incidents in the first nine months of 2013.5 Changes in
the amount of information available and the scope and
research resources of the study make it impossible to
determine whether there has been an increase in attacks
or, rather, more extensive monitoring or reporting of them.
