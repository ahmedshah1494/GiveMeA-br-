The recruitment of child soldiers represents another form of attack on education because it prevents children going to school and can gravely harm their development, due to the atrocities they witness or are ordered to commit. The latter range from killing friends and members of their own families, to dismembering bodies and drinking human blood. Many are abducted and recruited at gunpoint from school. Others volunteer either out of fear, desperation to escape poverty or abuse at home, or even because the education system has failed them. But enlistment of children under 15 years of age is a category of war crime and there is a case for extending that to enlistment under age 18 on similar grounds to the treatment of under-age sexual intercourse, which in some African countries falls under the same legal deﬁ nition (deﬁ lement) as rape, whether it is consensual or not.
