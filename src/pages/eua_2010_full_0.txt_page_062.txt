They were ambushed by five gunmen in Logar Province. The Taliban described them as foreign spies and the two marked IRC vehicles they attacked as belonging to “foreign invader forces”. According to the BBC, aid agencies are frequently targeted in Afghanistan, with convoys attacked and staff abducted or killed: 19 aid workers were killed in 2008 as of 13 August, more than in the whole of 2007. There were an estimated 84 attacks on aid agencies from 1 January to 13 August 2008.125Possible motives for Taliban attacks on education aid workers specifically may include ideological opposition to their work in supporting the education of girls or education in general. But they may also be carried out to punish those who “collaborate with the enemy” by delivering aid.There is also a trend in both Afghanistan and Somalia for armed groups and criminals to collude to seize resources, remove a perceived threat to control over a local area or make a political show of strength.126 Lawlessness and banditry may also be factors: in Sudan, they are thought to be the most common cause of attack. Kidnapping of aid workers increased by 350 per cent from 2006 to 2009.127Violent incidents against aid workers, including killing, kidnapping and armed attacks, have increased sharply since 2006, particularly for international NGO staff and UN local contractors, with 60 per cent of violent incidents occurring in Sudan (Darfur), Afghanistan and Somalia, according to the Aid Worker Security Database, created by the Center on International Cooperation in New York and the Overseas Development
