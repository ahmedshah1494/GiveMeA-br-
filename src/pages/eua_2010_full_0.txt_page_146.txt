The number of incidents monitored by MRM country-level Task Forces has increased, which represents an important advance. Given the specific focus of the MRM on children in armed conflict under specific circumstances, however, this system is inadequate to provide global monitoring at all levels of an education system and of all categories targeted in each of the countries where attacks are occurring. At present, efforts still fall short of providing a comprehensive, global monitoring system.An examination of the motives of attackers reveals many different underlying causes, but some recurring risk factors that should be explored further and addressed include: The misuse of schools to impose alien values; The failure to create a sense of community ownership of schools and the education process; The blurring of the distinction between military operations and aid operations; and The belief held by many repressive regimes that it is acceptable to assert their power by limiting the scope of education, particularly higher education, through brute force. The apparent deterrent effect of giving communities a say in the running of schools and the defence of their schools deserves deeper consideration.Attacks on schools, universities, students, teachers, academics and all other education personnel are not just an attack on civilians and civilian buildings. They are an attack on the right to education, development and democracy.A possible correlation between attacks on higher education and fragility has been articulated. More research is needed to establish this link and to see if it also holds for attacks on schools. A glance at the roll call of states suffering the highest number of attacks suggests this is likely to be the case.Protecting education is an important part of creating stability and the reverse seems also to be true. The vast demolition of schools seen in certain conflict situations can be a contributing factor in a downward spiral of violence and increased displacement of populations.
