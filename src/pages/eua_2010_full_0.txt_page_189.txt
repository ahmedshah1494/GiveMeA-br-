The ICRC’s interpretation is that the occupying power must not only refrain from hindering the operation of education institutions, it must seek to “support them actively and even encourage them if the responsible authorities of the country fail in their duty”.548According to the Right to Education Campaign in the occupied Palestinian territory, Palestinian child detainees held in seven detention camps in the West Bank are being denied education. Only two out of five prisons in Israel provide any form of education: one offers two hours a week and the other, nine hours a week.549In 2007, an alleged 3,000 young Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons were not allowed to sit the final-year examination for secondary schooling.550The International Court of Justice’s Advisory Opinion on the Wall (the 703 km-long Israeli West-Bank Barrier, being built to prevent suicide attacks) found that it illegally impeded the exercise of Palestinians’ right to education by cutting off teachers and students from their schools in east Jerusalem.551Since 2004, the Israeli army has arrested more than eight elected representatives of the Student Council of Birzeit University, five of whom were presidents of the Council at the time of arrest. Their role was to represent the interests of some 7,000 students before the university administration, take responsibility for welfare programmes for students, provide sports and cultural activities and help with registration, fee payment and their studies. Fadi Hamad, who as president was arrested by Israeli military special forces on 25 November 2007, said: “The arrested students who worked for the Student Council focused solely on providing local academic support for students and nothing else”.552 In 2008, the Right to Education Campaign noted that 21 of 40 cases represented by Birzeit University’s lawyers involved political prisoners who were jailed solely for belonging to student societies or political parties; many of them held positions of leadership in the Student Council at the time of arrest. They were being denied their freedom, their freedom of association, and their education.553
