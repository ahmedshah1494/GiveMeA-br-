ISRAeL/PALeSTINe
Palestinian schools and universities were targeted with
air strikes, attacked by Israeli settlers and in some
cases used by Israeli armed forces as interrogation
centres or surveillance posts. Israeli schools were hit
by indiscriminate rocket fire.913

Context
Hundreds of incidents of attacks on education –
including killing and injury of students and teachers,
and damage to schools during fighting – were
documented in Israel/Palestine in 2009-2012 by the
UN. The great majority of incidents occurred in
connection with the Israeli military operations ‘Cast
Lead’ (27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009) and
‘Pillar of Defence’ (14 November 2012 to 21 November
2012) in Gaza, and with Israeli administrative and
military arrangements in Area C of the West Bank.
Palestine is comprised of the West Bank
(including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, with
Israel located between the two. Control of the land and
education systems is divided between different
authorities. The Israeli Ministry of Education is responsible for education in Israel, and the Palestinian
Ministry of Education and Higher Education, the
Hamas-run education ministry in the Gaza Strip, the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and
private providers run schools in the West Bank and
Gaza.
Attacks on education in the West Bank are largely
linked to territorial, administrative and security
arrangements. Following the Israeli-Palestinian
Interim Agreement (commonly known as the Oslo
Accords), it was divided into Areas A (Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) military and civil control), B
(PNA civil/Israeli military control) and C (Israeli civil
and military control, comprising more than 60 per cent
of the West Bank).914 Sources of tension and violence
include the expansion of Israeli settlements that dot
Area C, restrictions on Palestinian construction and
movement imposed by the Israeli military, violence
and intimidation by the Israeli military and the
violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers and Palestinian
militants and protesters.915 In particular, education is
adversely affected by restrictions on movement,
curfews, denial of building permits and the issuing of
150

demolition orders against schools, settler attacks on
schools and universities, and actions of Israeli military
forces.916
In Gaza and southern Israel, education suffers
primarily from active armed conflict between Israel
and the Hamas government, which violently ousted
the PNA from Gaza in 2007, and other Palestinian
factions.917 An ongoing back-and-forth pattern of
Palestinian rocket launches and Israeli artillery fire
and airstrikes has damaged schools primarily in Gaza
but also in Israel.
UNOCHA reported in July 2013 that 13 schools located
within the Access Restricted Areas in Gaza, established in 2000, had been damaged or had classes
disrupted by the enforcement of restrictions on access
in the area extending up to 1.5 kilometres from the
border with Israel. According to UNESCO, schools in
the restricted area have also been damaged by the
activity of Palestinian armed groups, some of whose
rockets have fallen short and hit schools in Gaza
during the reporting period.918
Israel’s closures of border crossings, limits on sea
access, and restrictions on access to land areas
limited the entrance of building materials and
prevented travel of Gazan students and education
staff.919 Moreover, Egyptian authorities imposed tight
restrictions on Palestinian students and education
staff crossing the border at Rafah, in southern Gaza.
Gazan authorities also limited students’ travel outside
the area.920
Conflict has also caused physical harm and
psychosocial distress to students and education staff.
In Gaza, during Operation Cast Lead, 265 students and
teachers were killed and 875 injured;921 during
Operation Pillar of Defence, 21 students and school
staff and teachers were killed and 343 injured. In both
cases, it is not known how many casualties resulted
from targeted attacks.922 In southern Israel, students
and staff face the constant fear of intermittent attacks
on civilian areas by unguided rockets and mortars
launched by Palestinians from Gaza, which have hit
schools and school transport, killing one student and
injuring another, and injuring a bus driver, during
2009-2012.923
The first Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in
three years restarted on 29 July 2013.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Net primary school enrolment in Israel was 97 per cent
and net secondary school enrolment was 98 per cent
(2010), while in Palestine, these figures were 87 per
cent and 81 per cent (2011) respectively.924 At tertiary
level, gross enrolment was 62 per cent (2009) in Israel
and 51 per cent (2011) in Palestine.925

involving the vandalizing of school buildings in the
West Bank by Israeli settlers were documented in UN
and media reports. On 21 October 2010, for example,
vandals alleged to be settlers set fire to a storage room
in a West Bank Palestinian girls’ school and left graffiti
on its walls.933

In both the West Bank and Gaza, educational
achievement has dropped in recent years, with
examinations showing a decline in overall results.926
In Israel, rocket attacks have caused thousands of
students to miss out on learning periodically.927

An Islamist Palestinian armed group claimed responsibility for setting fire to an UNRWA summer school for
Palestinian children in Beit Lahia in May 2010; and an
unidentified group of 25 armed militants set fire to a
similar summer school in Central Gaza in June 2010.934
One Palestinian rocket landed near an Israeli kindergarten in 2010.935

Attacks on schools
Both Israeli armed forces and settlers in the West Bank
and Israeli armed forces and Palestinian armed groups
in Gaza and southern Israel allegedly perpetrated
attacks on schools and other education facilities.
During Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009, at least 280
out of 641 schools in Gaza were reportedly damaged
and another 18 destroyed.928 It is not specified how
many were damaged in targeted attacks; many were
damaged during firing at Palestinian military positions
and training sites. Incidents during the reporting
period included the total destruction by aerial
bombardment on 3 January 2009 of the American
School in Beit Lahia, in the north of the Gaza Strip,
which Israel claimed Palestinian armed groups were
using as a firing position (this was disputed by local
residents and the school’s director);929 and damage to
the Beit Lahia Elementary School, an UNRWA school,
as a result of Israeli forces’ shelling with white
phosphorous, killing two boys and injuring 13 others
who were using the school as an emergency shelter.930
The impact of the destruction of schools was subsequently compounded by an ongoing blockade
imposed by Israel931 that restricted access to building
materials and other education supplies required to
repair the damage, resulting in substandard school
facilities, overcrowded classrooms and the underresourcing of educational activities.932
In 2009 and 2010, the UN reported instances of Israeli
forces being in schools following raids, forced entry,
and search and arrest operations. In some cases, tear
gas was used on students. The incidents resulted in
damage to schools, interruption of education and
placed students’ safety at risk. A number of incidents

In 2011, according to the UN, there were 46 incidents
of violence related to education.936 In six instances,
settler violence targeted schools in the West Bank;
these cases involved settlers throwing objects such as
rocks and bottles at schools, physically assaulting
children and teachers inside schools, and vandalizing
schools with graffiti and arson.937 In one case, Israeli
settlers set fire to a prayer room at a school in the
Nablus governorate.938
In 11 incidents during 2011, Israel Defence Forces (IDF)
fire in Gaza, targeting military installations or training
sites, damaged schools.939 Among these was an
UNRWA school, reportedly damaged by Israeli
airstrikes in December 2011.940 Two schools were
damaged in 2011 by Palestinian rockets aimed at
Israel, but which landed in Gaza.941 In one instance,
unknown masked and armed men attacked and
vandalized an UNRWA summer games facility.942
In 2011, there were 11 instances of IDF personnel
entering schools in the West Bank – with no reasons
given or known. In some of these instances, schools
were affected as a result of clashes occurring close to
them and tear gas canisters landing inside school
grounds.943 According to a UN respondent, in some
instances the IDF entered schools to ‘intimidate’ staff
and pupils against stone throwing.944
Also in 2011, there were four instances of indiscriminate rockets launched from Gaza resulting in damage
to schools in southern Israel. In one specific instance,
an anti-tank missile from Gaza hit a school bus and
killed a 16-year-old Israeli boy. It is not possible to
ascertain if any of these attacks was targeted.945

In November 2012, the Israeli military operation Pillar
of Defence, in which Israeli forces targeted military
installations and training sites, resulted in the
damage of more than 290 school buildings in Gaza,946
including 60 UNRWA school buildings.947 Rockets
launched by Palestinian armed groups during the
hostilities damaged six school buildings in seven
incidents in southern Israel.948 Schools in both Gaza
and southern Israel within a 40-kilometre radius of the
border with Gaza were closed as fighting intensified.949
The UN documented 27 additional incidents of
violence related to education in the West Bank in
2012.950 There were 21 instances of IDF personnel
entering Palestinian schools.951 Israeli military
personnel conducting security sweeps ahead of Israeli
settlers’ night-time religious events entered the Haj
Ma’zoz Al Masri Secondary School for Girls in Nablus
on six separate occasions.952 Eleven other times,
Israeli forces tried, sometimes successfully, to enter
school premises, often during search operations,
disrupting classes and sometimes damaging schools.
Israeli forces fired tear gas or live ammunition at
schools in another four instances in 2012.953 For
instance, on 13 November 2012, Israeli police
allegedly fired tear gas inside Aba Secondary Mixed
School, causing 29 students to seek medical
attention, after violence erupted when interior
ministry officials attempted to post demolition orders
for illegal building work.954
In 2012, Israeli settlers from the Yitzhar settlement
threw stones at the Palestinian school in Urif (near
Nablus) on four separate occasions. One incident, on
23 April 2012, triggered clashes between Palestinians
and Israeli forces and settlers during which teargas
was fired, injuring eight Palestinian children.955
Demolition and stop-work orders
In 2011 alone, Israeli authorities issued nine schools
in Area C of the West Bank with demolition or stopwork orders,956 bringing the total number of such
schools to 38, including several considered at
imminent risk, and affecting 4,300 children.957 Under
these orders, schools cannot be rehabilitated to meet
minimum humanitarian standards or can be demolished at any time.958 Such orders can represent a
