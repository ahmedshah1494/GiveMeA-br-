CôTe D’IvOIRe
In Côte d’Ivoire, armed groups and military forces
destroyed, damaged, looted or used almost 500
schools and universities during the 2010-2011 postelection crisis.598

Context
Civil conflict divided Côte d’Ivoire for more than a
decade and caused the deaths of thousands of
civilians. In 2002, a rebellion in the north led to a
military-political stalemate in which the rebels, known
as the New Forces, retained territory in defiance of the
government-controlled south. At this time, the
majority of teachers in the north fled and nearly all
primary and secondary schools there ceased to
function. Despite a 2007 peace agreement, few
teachers returned to the north and, as a result,
hundreds of thousands of children continued to miss
out on education.599
People hoped that the presidential elections, held in
October 2010 after repeated delays, would mark an
end to the conflict. But renewed violence erupted
when the incumbent president, Laurent Gbagbo,
refused to concede victory to the internationally recognized president-elect, Alassane Ouattara, after a
run-off vote in November 2010. Several months of
failed negotiations led to fighting that left some 3,000
dead and at least 500,000 displaced.600 During this
period, members of the Student Federation of Côte
d’Ivoire (FESCI) – a pro-Gbagbo militant student group
created in the 1990s – spread fear throughout the
education system by attacking students, teachers and
officials. The situation came to a head in April 2011
when pro-Ouattara forces overran the south and
captured Gbagbo in Abidjan, with the support of
French forces.
Gross primary enrolment was 90 per cent (2011), while
the rate of transition to secondary school was 49 per
cent (2011)601 and gross tertiary enrolment was 8 per
cent (2009).602 The adult literacy rate was 57 per cent
(2011).603
