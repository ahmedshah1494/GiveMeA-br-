The role of communities
in protecting education
The limited amount of research that has been
undertaken on programmes to protect
education suggests that communities have a
crucial role to play in preventing and
responding to attacks.228 However, less is
known about the outcomes of community
engagement or the conditions for its success.
This chapter summarizes key findings across a
range of protection measures – such as physical
protection, monitoring, advocacy and negotiation – in which communities have played an
active part. Different approaches to engaging
with communities are analysed and lessons are
drawn with the aim of improving support for the
protection of education at the local level
Communities have an important role to play in
protecting education from attack.229 In many conflictaffected countries in particular, governments may lack
the capacity or will to fully protect education.230 For
example, in northern Liberia, where attacks on
students and schools continued to occur after the
conflict, some communities organized student escorts
and provided unarmed guards at schools to improve
their physical security.231 Communities in Afghanistan
have protected schools in instances where they know
and are able to negotiate with the perpetrators of
attack.232 Often, national and international actors can
support community action. In Nepal, for example,
NGO investments in capacity-building ensured that
school management committees were more representative of the community and reportedly reduced
threats to education.However, a community-based
approach can present certain risks to the individuals
involved. In eastern DRC and Nepal, community
members monitoring attacks have reported being
threatened.233
