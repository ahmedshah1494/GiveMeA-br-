SOUTH SUDAN
Schools were destroyed, damaged and looted by
armed groups and armed forces during
inter-communal violence and border incursions during
2009-2013. Dozens of schools were used for military
purposes, some for up to five years.1427

Context
South Sudan gained independence in July 2011.1428
However, cross-border skirmishes and intercommunal violence continued to pose threats to
civilians. The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) also
launched sporadic incursions and abduction raids
during the first half of the reporting period. An
internal conflict broke out between rebels and the
government in December 2013, leading to killings
along ethnic lines.
Two decades of civil war prior to its independence
from Sudan greatly hindered the development of the
education system. Schools were occupied and
damaged or destroyed, teachers and students
displaced and children abducted or forcibly recruited
by both sides.1429
Gross enrolment was 64 per cent at primary level and
6 per cent at secondary level in 2012.1430 Protracted
conflict has left South Sudan with an adult literacy
rate of only 27 per cent.1431

Attacks on schools
Attacks on schools became less frequent after the
signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in
2005, but some school buildings were damaged or
destroyed during inter-communal violence, LRA
activity and incursions along the contested border
with Sudan during 2009-2012.
In one incident, during fighting between Sudan
People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) forces and cattlekeepers in Warrap state in March 2010, four schools
were destroyed.1432 Thirteen schools were set on fire
during inter-ethnic fighting in Jonglei state from late
2011 to early 2012.1433
From July 2009 to February 2012, the UN verified two
attacks on schools by the LRA.1434
