Attacks on higher education
The study found attacks on higher education facilities,
students and academics and military use of universities were
reported in 28 of the 30 profiled countries in 2009-2012. The
exceptions were CAR and Mali.
Unlike most attacks on schools, violent attacks on higher
education frequently take place in non-conflict situations –
although they do also occur in countries affected by war – and
more often involve arbitrary arrest, detention or persecution of
particular students and teachers.
Many attacks on higher education are linked to government
attempts to prevent the growth of opposition movements;
restrict political protests, including those related to education
policy; stop anti-government protests on campus; quell
education trade union activity; or curtail the freedom of
lecturers and researchers to explore or discuss sensitive

subjects or alternative views to government policy. As with
violence against school students and teachers, attacks on
higher education can also involve sectarian bias and targeting
of ethnic groups.
During 2009-2013, most attacks on education buildings were
directed at school facilities rather than those used for higher
education. However, higher education facilities were attacked
in at least 17 countries: Afghanistan, Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Egypt,
Iran, Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Libya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan,
the Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and
Yemen. In Mexico, for example, a group opposing nanotechnology research reportedly bombed six campuses and
research laboratories and threatened six others in 2011; and in
Syria, two explosions at Aleppo University killed at least 82
and wounded dozens more, possibly as many as 150, on the
first day of mid-term examinations in January 2013.
