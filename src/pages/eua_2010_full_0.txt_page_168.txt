In the first half of 2009, it is estimated that thousands of women and young girls were raped by Rwandan and rebel groups in eastern Kivu and Orientale Province.401 Between 2007 and 2008, the UN recorded 5,517 cases of sexual violence against children in the conflict areas of Ituri and North and South Kivu; 31 per cent of sexual violence victims were children, according to Human Rights Watch.402 In Kisangani, in the northern part of the country, 60 per cent of cases of sexual and gender-based violence involved victims aged 11 to 17, according to Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary-General.403 The Minister for Gender, Family and Children estimates that more than one million women and girls have become victims of sexual violence.404 Girls are targeted mostly on their way to or from school and at markets, according to UNICEF.405 Victims’ lack of access to clinics and the stigmatizing of rape victims are serious obstacles to obtaining accurate figures.In April 2009, one abducted school director in Masisi reportedly died of exhaustion during forced labour.406Between December 2008 and May 2009, eight schools were attacked due to an order to LRA soldiers to abduct and integrate 1,000 new persons, aged 25 and below, into the force. Most of the abductions took place in March.407In higher education, 47 academics applied to the Scholar Rescue Fund for relocation grants from 2002 to 2007 to avoid acts of persecution, including death warrants, torture and illegal detention.408
