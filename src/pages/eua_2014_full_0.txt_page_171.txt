
secondary level (2007-2011).1360 Only 20 per cent of
the population was literate in 2012.1361
The conflict intensified in late 2006, following the
overthrow of the Islamist Court Union (ICU) by
Ethiopian armed forces. An offshoot of the ICU, an
armed Islamist group known as Al-Shabaab slowly
began to establish control over Mogadishu and other
areas of south and central Somalia.1362 Government
forces, backed at different times by Ethiopian, Kenyan
and African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)
troops,1363 along with government-affiliated militia
including the Sufi Islamist group Ahlu Sunna Wal
Jama’a (ASWJ)1364 and more recently the Ras Kamboni
clan militia,1365 have been fighting Al-Shabaab. After
mid-2011 and especially in 2012, the African Union
forces and Ethiopian troops, alongside Somali
government forces and allied militia, regained control
of a number of towns held by Al-Shabaab in southcentral Somalia. However, Al-Shabaab retains
authority over large swathes of south-central Somalia,
particularly in rural areas of the country.1366

Attacks on schools
The UN verified 79 attacks on education between
January 2011 and December 2012 alone, affecting at
least 5,677 children.1367 However, security challenges
and lack of access to large areas of south-central
Somalia made it impossible to determine the exact
number of schools, students and education staff
attacked.1368
Indiscriminate mortar fire exchanged in civilian areas,
particularly in the country’s capital Mogadishu,
endangered schools, damaging and destroying
buildings and killing or wounding students and
teachers. For example, a mortar shell that landed in a
Koranic school killed four students and wounded 10
others during fighting between Transitional Federal
Government armed forces and armed groups in
Mogadishu on 13 January 2009.1369 On 25 February
2009, two schools were damaged, six schoolchildren
killed and another 13 wounded during an exchange of
fire between the TFG/AMISOM military and insurgents,
also in Mogadishu.1370
Several students reported to Human Rights Watch that
their schools had been targeted by Al-Shabaab,

including during the Ramadan Offensive in Mogadishu
in August 2010. For example, one boy recounted that
his school had been ‘continually attacked’ by AlShabaab during the offensive and that, in one
incident, a neighbouring classroom had been shelled.
Another student claimed that in Baidoa, in late 2010,
Al-Shabaab militants pulled up outside his school and
shelled it.1371

curriculum.1381 In April 2010, Al-Shabaab reportedly
forbade schools in Jowhar from announcing the end of
classes with bells because they were reminiscent of
those rung in churches.1382 This violence and
harassment has caused teachers to flee, hundreds of
schools to close for varying lengths of time, and
students, particularly girls, to drop out in large
numbers.1383

Explosives placed on or near school grounds seriously
endangered students and teachers. In one case, a
bomb planted near Mahamud Harbi Secondary
School, in Wardhigley, exploded in November 2011,
killing four children.1372 In August 2012, explosives left
outside a school killed at least six children aged from 5
to 10 and injured at least four more who were playing
with them in the town of Balad.1373

In one instance, a teacher reported to Human Rights
Watch that he fled Somalia in 2011 after the head
teacher and deputy at his school were shot for refusing
to stop teaching certain subjects. At his previous
school, Al-Shabaab fighters had stabbed him in the
upper lip with a bayonet while he was teaching a
geography lesson and had abducted a female teacher
not wearing a hijab. Her body was later found near the
town mosque.1384

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
1374

In October 2011, a suicide attack by Al-Shabaab at
the Ministry of Education killed an estimated 100 or
more people,1375 many of whom were students and
parents waiting for scholarship examination results.
Another suicide bombing at Benadir University’s
graduation ceremony (see Attacks on higher
education) in Mogadishu killed the Minister of
Education in December 2009;1376 and eight students
were killed in a suicide bombing on school grounds
carried out by an 11-year-old disguised as a food seller
in October 2009.1377
In areas it controlled, Al-Shabaab imposed its interpretation of Islam on schools and threatened or killed
teachers for refusing to comply with its demands. 1378
This included prohibiting the teaching of English,
geography and history; forcing the separation of girls
and boys in schools and restricting girls’ dress;
preventing women from teaching; imposing their own
teachers in schools; and using class time to teach
extreme Islamist ideology.1379 The US State
Department reported that, in at least one instance in
2011, Al-Shabaab offered to reward academic
achievement with AK-47 rifles.1380 In September 2009,
Al-Shabaab warned against using UN-provided
textbooks, claiming they were teaching students ‘unIslamic’ subjects. They also called for parents not to
send their children to schools using a UN-supported

In a similar vein, Hizbul Islam, an armed Islamist group
which merged with Al-Shabaab in late 2010,
reportedly arrested a head teacher who had raised a
Somali flag over his school in December 2009. The
group replaced the flag with a black Islamist one.
Students took to the street in protest, drawing fire
from Hizbul Islam militants that killed at least two
students and injured another five.1385 In other
instances, teachers were targeted for refusing to enlist
students as Al-Shabaab fighters (see Child
recruitment from schools).
Some teachers, students and education officials were
also kidnapped and held for ransom during 20092012 including the education minister for the region of
Galmudug, reportedly for refusing to pay a ransom for
the release of a kidnapped student.1386
Insecurity and Al-Shabaab threats impeded humanitarian and development assistance for education,
with particular agencies, humanitarian workers,
offices and supplies targeted.1387 Al-Shabaab
proclaimed a ban on more than a dozen individual
agencies from 2009 onwards and imposed another
ban in 2011 on 16 aid organizations operating in areas
under its control, including several UN agencies.1388
On 6 January 2009, three masked gunmen shot and
killed 44-year-old Somali national Ibrahim Hussein
Duale while he was monitoring school feeding in a
