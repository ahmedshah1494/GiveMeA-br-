
Attacks on schools
The Education Cluster reported in March 2013 that 130
schools had been occupied, looted or destroyed,
although it is not specified whether all of the latter
were targeted.1051 Schools throughout the north were
damaged while being pillaged, primarily by the Tuareg
insurgents, but also, to a lesser extent, by armed
Islamist groups and local populations.1052 Landmines
and unexploded ordnance located in and around
schools in conflict-affected communities also placed
thousands of children at risk and, in at least one case,
damaged a school in Bourem in 2012.1053

Military use of schools
In August 2012, NGOs reported that armed groups
were using 21 schools.1054 According to the UN, in
September 2012, military troops and pro-government
militia, notably the ‘Ganda-koi’, were using at least 14
schools in the region of Mopti, affecting 4,886
students.1055
Human Rights Watch identified 18 places, including
private, public and Koranic schools, where armed
Islamist groups were reportedly training new recruits,
including children as young as 11. For example, one
witness described seeing some 20 children both
studying the Koran and receiving weapons’ training at
a Koranic school in a northern town in July 2012.1056

Attacks on education in 2013
During the first part of 2013, French aerial
bombardment was reported to have damaged several
schools allegedly being used by armed groups1057
including one in Bourem, one in Douentza, one in
Timbuktu town and at least one other in Diabaly.1058 In
early January, a schoolyard shared by a primary school
and a secondary school in Konna was occupied by
Malian Armed Forces as they prepared for combat,
closing the schools for nearly a month.1059 Landmines
and unexploded ordnance located in and around
schools continued to place students and teachers at
risk.1060

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

MexICO
Teachers in more than 75 schools were threatened,
more than 50 students, teachers, academics and
education officials were killed or abducted with their
whereabouts unknown, and nanotechnology
researchers were targeted with bombs in 2009-2012.

Context
Attacks on teachers, academics and students took
place in the context of high levels of general violence,
including the abduction without trace of large
numbers of children and adults.1061 Heavily armed
criminal groups fought over territory and control of the
drug trade – the main source of heroin and cocaine
entering the United States – and against security
forces trying to dismantle them.1062 The drug cartels,
which have thousands of armed men, have increasingly diversified their operations, turning to other illicit
trades such as kidnappings and extortion. The federal
government began intensive security operations
against them in 2006, backed by 96,000 troops.1063 In
the course of counternarcotics operations, security
forces committed widespread human rights violations, including killings, torture and forced
disappearances.1064 According to the government,
more than 70,000 people were killed in drug-related
violence from December 2006 to December 2012, and
more than 26,000 more were victims of disappearances or otherwise went missing.1065
Teachers were among a long list of targets, reportedly
because of their regular salary.1066 Parents and
children were attacked at schools and police were
targeted while trying to protect educational establishments. In many cases, there was insufficient evidence
to establish who was responsible for the attacks
because few crimes were properly investigated by the
authorities.
In primary education, net enrolment was 96 per cent in
2011 and in secondary education it was 67 per cent;
gross enrolment at tertiary level was 28 per cent. Adult
literacy was 93 per cent in 2009.1067

Attacks on schools
During 2009-2012, there was evidence of three direct
attacks on school buildings plus additional threats
against schools.
In early December 2010, for example, gunmen set fire
to a kindergarten in Ciudad Juárez on the northern
border because teachers refused to pay extortion
fees,1068 and in September 2011, threats of grenade
attacks on schools in Santiago, in the north-eastern
state of Nuevo León, caused panic among parents.1069
Additionally, in July 2012, a kindergarten and a
primary school were destroyed in Turicato, Michoacán
state, by a Catholic sect called the Followers of the
Virgin of the Rosary. Members used sledgehammers
and pick-axes to destroy six classrooms, six
bathrooms, furniture and computers and then burned
down the buildings after a leader claimed she had
received an order from the Virgin Mary to destroy
them. The sect, whose rules prohibit formal schooling,
refused to accept the secular government curriculum,
especially on science and sexuality, or government
uniforms, preferring robes and a headscarf.1070
In 2009 and 2010, there were numerous gun battles in
the vicinity of schools, in some cases resulting in the
deaths of students, teachers or parents. In Reynosa, in
2009, 20 teachers reportedly struggled to keep up to a
thousand students lying on the floor with their heads
down while, for over two hours, grenades exploded
and classroom walls were peppered with bullets
around them.1071 On 30 August 2010, a shootout
between gunmen and marines in Tampico, Tamaulipas
state, as students were leaving school, left two
children dead and two adults wounded.1072

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
At least 14 school students,1073 12 school teachers1074
and two education officials1075 were killed in attacks on
education in 2009-2012. One teacher who was a
leading teacher trade unionist was abducted and his
whereabouts remain unknown.1076 Several school
students were also abducted.1077
The threat of violence related to criminal groups
Armed criminal groups in many cases demanded that
teachers pay them a proportion of their salary or face
