On one occasion, all schools in the three southernmost provinces were closed.188In Pakistan’s Swat District in NWFP, between January 2007 and March 2009, burnings, shellings, blasts and ransacking left 91 girls’ schools and 17 boys’ schools fully destroyed, and 25 girls’ schools and 39 boys’ schools partially damaged. The number of schools affected doubled during the Army’s counter-offensive; when schools re-opened for the first time in three months, many classes had to be taken in tents, many roads to schools were destroyed or closed for security reasons, and many students could not return to classes or their parents were afraid to send them.189 “My three children are keen to go back to school,” Ameena Bibi in Mingora told IRIN in August 2009. “My two daughters have not been since December last year when the Taliban banned education for girls. But there is no transport here for them to use”.190The Taliban ban on classes for girls forced the closure of 900 private and government schools.191 The placement of 300 newly qualified teachers was also postponed. The move threatened to do much more than reverse government efforts to tackle the extreme gender imbalance in Swat where only 28 per cent of women are literate compared to 67 per cent of men, and where only 19 per cent of females complete primary school compared to 58 per cent of males.

The activities of all NGOs were also banned for a long period in 2008, with some staff members facing persecution.A UNESCO education specialist in Harare warned: “The halt in the educational activities during the past years will have tremendous effects in the years to come,
