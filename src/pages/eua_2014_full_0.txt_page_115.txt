COLOMBIA
Some 140 school teachers were murdered and more
than 1,000 school teachers received death threats in
2009-2012, with threats increasing in 2013. Children
were recruited from school by armed groups and there
continued to be reports of public security forces using
schools for military purposes, despite legal curbs.

Context
Violence and abuses associated with Colombia’s
internal armed conflict, which has continued for nearly
half a century, have displaced more than 5 million
people.527 Approximately 220,000 people have died,
according to the government-created National Center
for Historical Memory.528
The main actors involved in the fighting have included
government armed forces and the police; left-wing
armed groups, notably the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation
Army (ELN); and right-wing paramilitaries, especially
the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC),
which underwent a deeply flawed official demobilization process during the administration of President
Álvaro Uribe (2002-2010). New paramilitary successor
groups, led largely by former paramilitaries, emerged
after the demobilization process.529
Juan Manuel Santos replaced Álvaro Uribe as
president in 2010 and initiated peace talks with the
FARC in November 2012.530
Human rights defenders, community leaders, trade
unionists, journalists, indigenous and Afro-Colombian
leaders, and displaced persons’ leaders have all faced
death threats and other abuses during the conflict.
According to the teachers’ trade union the Colombian
Federation of Educators (FECODE), 360 teachers were
murdered and 342 threatened in the decade up to
2009.531 The president of the National University of
Colombia is reported to have stated that the university
registered 312 reports of threats in 2007 and 2008.532
At least twelve Colombian university students were
killed between 2006 and 2008, most of whom were
well-known student leaders, according to a report by
the UK’s National Union of Students, University and
College Union and UK-based NGO Justice for
Colombia.533
