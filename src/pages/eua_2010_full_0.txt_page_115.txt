As monitoring has both improved and increased for child soldier recruitment, so, too, has expertise in the design and implementation of action plans. According to Alec Wargo, Programme Officer of the OSRSG-CAAC, a crucial lesson learned is that the Security Council Working Group is better equipped to make concrete recommendations when more in-depth analysis of the violations committed is available. “The monitoring and reporting of child soldiers has steadily improved since 2005,” says Wargo. “Also we have a lot more mainstreaming with child protection advisers on peace-keeping missions and other operations”.274Progress on child soldiersThe proof of progress on child soldier use and recruitment lies in the rate of de-listing from the annexes of the Secretary-General’s annual report. Countries are de-listed when the time-bound action plan has been fulfilled; in other words, when there is prevention of recruitment, accountability for those who recruit in violation of both local and international law, and access for the UN to verify what is being done.
