INDIA
Some 140 schools were attacked by militants in
2009-2012, and there was widespread use of schools
as barracks or bases by government forces, mostly in
the east of the country.

Context
Most attacks on education occurred in states affected
by a long-running insurgency led by Maoist and other
left-wing armed groups – also referred to as ‘Naxalites’
– operating in at least 83730 of India’s 600 districts,
mainly in the east.731
While the Maoists claim they are fighting on behalf of
the poorest rural communities in each state, national
authorities say they are obstructing desperately
needed development initiatives. The exploitation of
natural resources and how the profits are distributed
are key issues of contention.732
Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Orissa were
among the states most affected by the conflict in
2008. As part of their insurgency, Maoists attacked
government infrastructure, including schools, police
stations and armouries, and used landmines and
improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to launch
attacks.733
Maoist attacks on schools and teachers and security
forces’ use of school premises in operations against
the militants have led to falling attendance and
increased drop-out rates, particularly among girls.
They have also reduced the quality of education
provided to some of the country’s most disadvantaged
children.734
Pockets of tension fuelled by Hindu and Christian
extremists in some areas, particularly in the northeast, and low-level insurgency by separatists or terror
groups in several states, including in Jammu and
Kashmir, have also led to attacks on education.
Net primary enrolment was 93 per cent, gross
secondary enrolment was 69 per cent and gross
tertiary enrolment was 23 per cent (2011). The adult
literacy rate was 63 per cent (2006).735
