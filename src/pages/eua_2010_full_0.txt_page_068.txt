He saw it as a vibrant party, with many young people involved and one that respected the aspirations of academics and professionals. “But, in Zimbabwe, aligning yourself with the opposition is as good as applying for a death sentence,” he says. He moved from his first job in a secondary school in Buhera District, Manyika Province, home of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangarai, after three of his colleagues were abducted. He left his second job, teaching sociology and divinity at a secondary school in Renco, a rural town in Masvingo Province, when youth militia began targeting young people from colleges and universities.Then in 2005 he was offered a job at the Great Zimbabwe University (GZU), just outside Masvingo town, where the mantra is “You publish or you perish” and his life changed. He began writing about the problems affecting the people of the country and tried to look for solutions through his academic work.At GZU, Makahamadze was teaching courses in New Testament studies and New Testament Greek and wrote about social and religious issues, including the impact of forced slum clearances on the Johane Morange Apostolic Church, Adventist Christian perceptions of the 2008 general election, the impact of HIV & AIDS on the Adventist Church, and the role of traditional leaders in fostering democracy and social justice.Jointly with Takavafira Zhou, a GZU history lecturer (and President of the Progressive Teachers’ Union of Zimbabwe), he wrote a paper on the leadership of Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe’s president, who is also chancellor of GZU. The paper critically examined the views of supporters and opponents of Mugabe, and argued that his regime was tyrannical and oppressive and had undermined the spread of democracy in the world
