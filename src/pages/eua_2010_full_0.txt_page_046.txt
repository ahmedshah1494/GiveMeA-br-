Some armed groups, such as the Maoist rebels (Naxalites) in the north-eastern Indian states of Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Jharkhand, tend to blow up school buildings with dynamite and rarely target students or teachers. Others, such as the Islamic separatists in southern Thailand, typically firebomb schools but also assassinate individual teachers by shooting them, sometimes in front of their classes, and blow up police or army escorts protecting them on their way to or from school.Related armed groups may use different tactics. The Taliban in Pakistan tend to concentrate on firebombing schools but have rarely killed students or teachers; whereas in Afghanistan, high numbers of teachers and students have been killed deliberately, and schools have been burned, bombed, shelled and subjected to rocket and mortar attacks.The CARE study field assessment suggests that in Afghanistan the burning of schools has been the most frequent type of attack, followed by night letters, other warnings, explosions, armed attacks, killings, kidnappings and “terror”. One in five education personnel report having personally received threats.68Attacks on academics and trade unionists in countries such as Colombia, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq and Zimbabwe have involved death threats, abduction, forced disappearance, illegal arrests, beating, torture, assassination by bullets or car bombs, or some combination of these.Suicide bombings have been directed at large groups of university students or school pupils in Iraq and Afghanistan but are rare elsewhere.Some tactics are shared by state and rebel forces. There have been multiple reports of rebel groups arriving with trucks at schools in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to seize children for recruitment as child soldiers, while soldiers have seized children
