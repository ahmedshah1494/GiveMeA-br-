Arguably more plausible, given the extensive coverage within some countries, such as Thailand, is the likelihood of encouraging national investigations where appropriate laws exist.In her July 2009 report to the Human Rights Council, Radhika Coomaraswamy said that action at the international level must be underpinned by a commitment to address impunity at the national level. This includes undertaking appropriate reforms of national legislation for the protection of children in order to bring laws into line with international obligations, as well as addressing prevailing cultures of impunity for grave violations against children through â€œrigorous investigation and prosecution
