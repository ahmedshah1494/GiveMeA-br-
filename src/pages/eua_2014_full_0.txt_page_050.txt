
information on how the provision of education is
affected, let alone the wider social and economic
impact, is scant. However, a wide range of potential
effects can be hypothesized from individual effects
documented in media and human rights reports and
research into attacks on education.
Where attacks on education are persistent in an area
or the threat of force is used to block recovery from
attacks, the impact may well include any number of
the following effects which impinge on student
attainment and access to good-quality education:
• chronic disruption of attendance by students,
teachers and other education staff;
• permanent drop-out of students, teachers and
other education staff;
• falling recruitment of staff, leading to teacher
shortages, and declining enrolment of
students, hindering attempts to achieve
Education for All;111
• persistent demotivation and distraction of
students, teachers and other education staff by
fear or trauma and other factors that lower the
quality of teaching and impinge on students’
ability to learn;
• damage to or failure to repair or resupply infrastructure, textbooks and other learning
materials that reduces access, reduces the
quality of teaching and learning, and potentially puts students, teachers and other
education staff at risk;
• reduced government capacity to deliver
education or develop the education system;
• suspension or reduction in international aid for
education;
• falling recruitment of teacher trade unionists,
reducing their capacity to provide a teachers’
viewpoint on the development of education.112
Across countries where attacks are persistent, UN,
media and human rights reports indicate that
hundreds of thousands of children have been denied
access to education, in some cases for years, because
of the length of time schools are closed: either the reopening or rebuilding of schools is blocked by the

security threat or the government does not have the
capacity or the will to rebuild in a timely way. For
instance, in Yemen, 54 schools were closed for up to
two months after 143 attacks on education in 2011,
affecting 182,000 children. In Afghanistan, the
Ministry of Education reported that more than 590
schools were closed in vulnerable areas as of May
2012, compared to 800 or more in 2009.114 In some
cases, security threats or prolonged military use block
them being rebuilt or reopened, as in India where by

2009 police had occupied some schools for three
years and one for a decade,115 and in South Sudan,
where armed forces occupied some schools for up to
five years.116
