Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Before independence, there were a few isolated
attacks on students and education officials by the LRA
in Southern Sudan. For instance, in Tambura county,
Western Equatoria, in 2010, the LRA killed two state
education ministry officials,1435 and in a separate
incident abducted three children between the ages of
8 and 15 from schools during raids on villages.1436 The
LRA also abducted five children from a school in the
same county in February 2011.1437
Several student protests were met with excessive use
of force and resulted in arrest, injury and, in one case,
death. For instance, at a school in Central Equatoria
state on 28 December 2009, anti-riot police shot and
killed a 16-year-old who was taking part in a demonstration against the non-payment of teachers.1438 Two
people, including a teacher, were wounded when
police used live ammunition to break up a protest at
Juba Day Secondary School over an alleged land-grab
of school property in October 2012.1439

Military use of schools
Primary and secondary schools were used by armed
forces, often with the consent of local authorities,
either for temporary accommodation while travelling,
or as a base for operations against rebel militia or in
response to inter-communal violence. Mostly, schools
were used temporarily but some were used for up to
five years.1440 According to the Education Cluster, the
cost of rehabilitating a primary school after a period of
military use was approximately 200,000 South
Sudanese Pounds (USD 64,500).1441
Between 2011 and 2012, 34 schools were used for
military purposes, affecting 28,209 learners across
nine states.1442 For example, the SPLA was reported to
have used two schools as places to torture suspects in
2010.1443 At Kuerboani Primary School, in Unity state,
soldiers occupied the school at night while children
used the same facilities during the day. UN staff
witnessed children using classrooms where weapons
and grenades were stored.1444 By December 2012, 15 of
the 18 schools occupied that year were vacated.1445
