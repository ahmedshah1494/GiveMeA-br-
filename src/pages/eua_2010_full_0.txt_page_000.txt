On 12 November 2008 in southern Afghanistan, two motorcyclists rode up to a group of 15 girls and female teachers walking and chatting on their way to Mirwais Nika Girls High School, Kandahar. Some of the girls were wearing full burkhas, others just their school uniform of black coat and headscarf, with their faces exposed. When the motorcyclists threw a liquid over them, Atifa Biba, 14, screamed as she felt and smelled her skin burning. The liquid was battery acid. One of her friends quickly tried to wipe the liquid from her face. But she, too, was sprayed and as she called for help, the attackers struck again. Another girl, Latefa, 16, rushed to help her older sister, Shamsia. “One of them threw acid on my sister’s face. I tried to help her and then they threw acid on me, too,” she said. The attack left at least one girl blinded, two permanently disfigured and two others seriously hurt. As news of the attack spread, countless more became afraid to walk to school. Atifa’s aunt, Bib Meryam, said the family was now considering keeping her at home.1The incident was covered prominently in the pages of the international press and stirred world opinion. It showed that the issue of attacks on education has lost none of its ability to provoke shock at the lengths to which armed groups, armed forces and political elements are prepared to go to further their political aims. The attackers were reportedly paid 100,000 Pakistani rupees ($1,187) for each of the 15 girls they were able to burn.2
