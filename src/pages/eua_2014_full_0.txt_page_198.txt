In February 2011, the MDC alleged that war veteran
leader Jabulani Sibanda closed schools across a
whole district in Masvingo and forced teachers and
schoolchildren to attend his pro-Zanu-PF meeting,
where he said MDC members would be killed. He had
reportedly used the same tactics in other parts of
Masvingo, Mashonaland Central and Manicaland
provinces over the previous year.1777 The PTUZ
confirmed that teachers in Gutu had left their jobs
because of death threats from Sibanda. 1778
There were also several reports of Zanu-PF militia
imposing their ideology on school curricula. In some
cases, Zanu-PF leaders forced teachers to attend ‘reeducation camps’, allegedly so that they could
‘experience the pain and suffering endured by liberation war heroes’.1779 The threat of violence was
ever-present, as Zanu-PF set up bases in some areas to
intimidate, beat and torture people who refused to
comply with their demands.1780 PTUZ claimed that
history teachers found it hard to teach the subject
without being accused of attacking Zanu-PF and
avoided teaching ‘true history’ for their own
safety.1781 In one case, a head teacher was told that war
veterans were going to visit his school to teach
history.1782
Zanu-PF supporters threatened at least one head
teacher and two teachers because they accepted gifts
or grants for their schools from political opponents of
Zanu-PF. A head teacher at Mapor Primary School,
Mutare North, fled, fearing for his life, when Zanu-PF
came looking for him at the school after they learned
that he had accepted funds under the Constituency
Development Fund (CDF) from an MDC-T senator.1783
Two teachers left Chatindo Primary School in Nyanga
North after Zanu-PF youths threatened them for
accepting five rolls of barbed wire paid for by the
CDF.1784

Military use of schools
Although the exact number is unknown, human rights
organizations found evidence of some schools being
used as bases by militia groups, including Zanu-PF
youth militia, in Masvingo province, Manicaland
province and several other rural areas. In one incident,
Zanu-PF youth militia allegedly camped at Chikurudzo
primary and secondary schools in Masvingo North,
