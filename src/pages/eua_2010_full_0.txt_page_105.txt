The forced closure of schools for strikes imposed by the Maoists had prevented pupils from taking their examinations. Schools were being taken over as military bases. Thousands of students and teachers were being captured for indoctrination programmes, and children were being recruited as child soldiers. Maoists were extorting up to 15 per cent of teachers’ pay and forcing the use of curricula that conflicted with those of the state.250On the other hand, schools were seen as tools for stabilizing the Royalist regime, for instance because pictures of the Royal family were placed on the wall or in text books.251In 2004, UNICEF and partner organizations were urged by stakeholders to mount a Schools as Zones of Peace (SZOP) initiative. UNICEF supported World Education and other partners to:Create a module for negotiating and developing school codes of conduct to safeguard them as zones of peace, in which local community facilitators convened negotiations with Maoists, army, civil society and other stakeholder groups to cease targeting schools;Mobilize civil society to keep the conflict out of schools using local media, which monitored threats to schools through the educational journalists’ association;Provide psychosocial and other support for students affected by conflict;Provide support and coping skills to teachers; andTeach landmine awareness and protection.252
