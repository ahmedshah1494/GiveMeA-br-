This has resulted in parents refusing to send their children to school.311The deterrent effect of ICC activitySince 22 June 2009, the OTP has been working in close cooperation with a Special Adviser on Crime Prevention, Juan E. Méndez, to research how the impact of the Office’s work can be maximized and how it contributes to the prevention of massive atrocities.“Our mission is to end impunity for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole – war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide – and to contribute to the prevention of such crimes in the future, which might include ‘attacks on education’,” an OTP spokesman said.The impact of each of its activities has to be maximized, from the analysis of information to the beginning of the investigation to the trial. The aim is for each investigation and prosecution to reverberate not just locally but in all States Parties.“When massive crimes are planned, the announcement of an analysis or investigation can have a preventative impact. Even the mere monitoring of a situation by the Office – which is different from a formal investigation – can deter crimes from being committed,” the OTP said. “This effect is not limited to situations under investigation but extends to different countries around the world, by emphasizing such aspects as the absence of immunity for serious crimes or by showing that activities previously considered ‘normal’ - for example, the recruitment of child soldiers, including so-called ‘voluntary recruitment’ - are serious crimes that will be prosecuted”.The assertion that involvement of the ICC in cases influences states and non-state actors appears to be backed up by the research of Barnett and Jefferys, who found that the indictment of Lubanga and the two others in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on charges of recruitment of children had caught the attention of the world’s press far more than any of the measures and actions associated with SC Resolution 1612. They quote a UK government source who claimed parties to conflict “are much more frightened of the ICC than they are of sanctions”.312
