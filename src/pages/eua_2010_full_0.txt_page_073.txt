Two children were killed and 14 people suffered severe burns as the falling phosphorous set the school alight in numerous places and parts of the roof fell in. A report by Human Rights Watch alleged that the repeated use of air-burst white phosphorous artillery shells by the Israeli Defence Force in Operation Cast Lead, killing and maiming civilians, reflected a “pattern or policy of conduct”, was reckless in a densely populated urban area, and constituted a war crime.165 The Israeli authorities claimed they were used legitimately in accordance with combat doctrine. In defence of other attacks on schools, the Israeli forces published photographs marked with the location of alleged rocket launches from the vicinity of three school buildings, including two from inside a school compound and seven from an adjacent road or building.166 Human Rights Watch also reported that Hamas fighters had fired rockets from bases close to civilian areas, a violation of international humanitarian law. The long-term effect of the operation on Gaza’s education system was a costly degrading of infrastructure, a loss of teachers to death and injury, and a likely legacy of psychosocial distress or trauma among students and staff.167The report of the UN fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict, led by Justice Goldstone, found that both sides had committed serious war crimes which may amount to crimes against humanity; and that Israeli military planners deliberately followed a doctrine that involved the “application of disproportionate force and the causing of great damage and destruction to civilian property and infrastructure, and suffering to civilian populations”.168
