
Rights Commission of Pakistan documented a
campaign of targeted killings of teachers and other
education personnel considered to be ethnically nonBaloch, or who appeared to support the federal
government, for example, by flying a Pakistani flag at
school, teaching Pakistani history or asking children
to sing the national anthem.1233 The Baloch Liberation
Army (BLA) and the Baloch Liberation United Front
(BLUF) most commonly claimed responsibility for the
attacks. Most of these teachers were from Punjab
province. According to Human Rights Watch, teachers,
especially ethnic Punjabis, are seen as symbols of the
Pakistani state and of perceived military oppression in
Balochistan. The human rights organization reported
that at least 22 teachers and other education
personnel were killed in targeted attacks in
Balochistan between January 2008 and October
2010,1234 including Shafiq Ahmed, the provincial
minister for education, who was assassinated by the
BLUF in October 2009 outside his home.1235 In one
incident, Anwar Baig, a teacher at the Model High
School, Kalat, was shot nine times en route to school
by gunmen on motorbikes. The BLA claimed responsibility for his death.1236 On 24 July 2012, Abrar Ahmed,
the deputy director of schools in Balochistan, was
severely injured but survived an attack on his car in
Quetta.1237
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International
documented allegations of Pakistani intelligence and
security forces arbitrarily detaining or enforcing the
disappearance of students and teachers it suspected
of involvement in armed Baloch nationalist activities,
including the Baloch Student Organisation (Azad).1238
Fear among those who fit the armed nationalist
groups’ target profile led to lower teacher recruitment,
more transfer requests and lower attendance.1239 In
addition, Human Rights Watch cited a senior
government official who estimated that government
schools in Balochistan were only open for 120 working
days in 2009 compared to an average of 220 days for
the rest of the country.1240
Teachers opposed to the Pakistani Taliban or its
ideology or methods were also targeted, particularly in
the north-west. For example, on 22 January 2009,
Taliban militants killed a teacher at a private school in

Matta, Swat Valley, because he had refused to follow
the dress code.1241 On 12 June 2009, the head teacher
of a religious school in Lahore was killed in his office
within the religious school complex during a suicide
bomb attack. He appeared to have been targeted for
his outspoken view that suicide bombings and other
Taliban tactics were un-Islamic.1242
Accusations of blasphemy adversely affected teachers
as well as students. A Lahore teacher was threatened
and went into hiding after omitting a section of a
religious text she was copying by hand and
erroneously juxtaposing a line about the Prophet
Mohammad and one about street beggars.1243 A 200strong mob stormed the Farooqi Girls’ High School
where she taught, accused her of blasphemy,

vandalized the school and set fire to the property. The
77-year-old head teacher of the school where she
taught was arrested despite not having seen the text
until after the accusations of blasphemy emerged.1244
Attacks on education aid workers
Pakistani and foreign organizations promoting
education were unable to operate freely in many areas
of the country due to the threat of militant violence,
notably in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (KP).
