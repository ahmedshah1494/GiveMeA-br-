However, attacks on education also occur in pre-conflict situations, particularly in higher education, and Education in Emergencies programmes may not necessarily address the long-term impact of the degradation of the education system or the long-term compromises needed to make education inclusive and a factor in building peace. While an undeniably important step forward, any attempt to push for an action plan, resolution or declaration on Education in Emergencies is likely to be supported most by countries concerned with the proliferation of natural disasters, which may leave little room for addressing attacks on education adequately. Attacks on education clearly overlap with child protection concerns, particularly in armed conflict, including all six grave violations against children. But this focus may not extend to teachers and other education personnel and does not extend to higher education.UNESCO, charged with coordinating the worldwide drive for Education for All, and with a special responsibility for holistic support to education systems, is one UN body uniquely positioned to address the issue in all sub-sectors. It has played a key role in putting the issue on the international agenda by commissioning the Education under Attack studies, and hosting the Iraq education conference and a seminar of experts, ‘Protecting Education from Attack’. Yet the subject was not on the formal agenda of its World Conference on Higher Education Conference in July 2009.UNICEF, with its key role in aiding recovery of education, supporting long-term development of education and coordinating monitoring of attacks in the country Task Forces for children and armed conflict, offers a voice based on practical field experience and detailed knowledge of events on the ground. But its remit remains principally focused on early childhood and basic education in line with its mandate for children.The common interest binding all of these sectors and organizations is that attacks on education are an attack on the right to education as recognized by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Geneva Conventions, the 1966 Recommendation Concerning the Status of Teachers and the 1997 Recommendation Concerning the Status of Higher Education Personnel.
