For example, India’s Supreme Court ordered security forces to clear out of all
schools in Chhattisgarh state but almost half a year later the court noted that
“[T]he State of Chhattisgarh had categorically denied that any schools … were
continuing to be occupied by security forces, and in fact all such facilities had
been vacated. However, during the course of the hearings before this bench it
has turned out that the facts asserted in the earlier affidavit were erroneous, and
that in fact a large number of schools had continued to be occupied by security
forces.” Indian Supreme Court, “Nandini Sundar and Others v. State of

As stated in the methodology section, the statistical information on enrolment and literacy rates in profiled countries should be treated with caution,
especially in the case of those countries that have experienced considerable
disruption due to armed conflict, insecurity or instability. Though formally
correct, such statistical data may contain outdated information and may not
capture with full accuracy the actual educational situation of a country.

The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) indicates the number of students enrolled in
a particular level of education regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of
the population at the official age for a given level. It is therefore often a much
higher figure than the Net Enrolment Ratio (NER), which represents the
percentage of students enrolled at a particular level who actually belong to the
official age group for that level. This study cites NER whenever possible, but for
some countries and levels of education, GER is the only available figure and has
therefore had to be used instead.
