Attacks on education in 2013
Attacks spiked at the time of the Séléka rebellion in
late 2012 and heightened insecurity in 2013. An
assessment conducted by the Education Cluster in
CAR, which surveyed some 176 schools in conflictaffected areas, reported that at least 108 of the
schools had been looted or vandalized by rebels,
soldiers and local populations; 14 were hit by bullets
(in four cases intentionally, two of which occurred
while school was in session) and two were specifically
targeted by shells; and three were intentionally set on
fire.520
There were numerous alleged attacks on students and
teachers during the fighting in late 2012 and in 2013
that occurred at or near schools.521 According to the
Education Cluster, at least two teachers were
reportedly killed intentionally; the wife of a school
director was killed at school; and a school student was
shot dead. It also reported allegations of ‘many atrocities’ committed at schools in Haute-Kotto, including
the rape of girls and the killing of one teacher.522
Séléka members reportedly robbed or assaulted two
teachers, and entered at least one school and told
students if they returned to class they would be taken
hostage.523 In another case, a child soldier entered his
former school and threatened to detonate a grenade if
schooling continued.524
Between December 2012 and August 2013, at least 24
schools were occupied or used by combatants in
Bamingui-Bangoran, Kémo, Ombella-M’Poko, Bangui,
Haute-Kotto, Nana-Grébizi and Ouaka prefectures,
four of which by the military.525 Many of these schools
reported looting and damage. 526
