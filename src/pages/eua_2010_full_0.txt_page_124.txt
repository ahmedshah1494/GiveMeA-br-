At a conference on Iraqi education, hosted by UNESCO in Paris in November 2008, there were widespread calls for investigations of those responsible for killing hundreds of university professors and intellectuals.290 At the UN General Assembly debate on Education in Emergencies in March 2009, there was an impassioned plea by Her Highness Sheikha Mozah Bint Nasser Al-Missned, of Qatar, to ensure that the perpetrators of attacks on education are punished.Her Highness, who is UNESCO Special Envoy for Basic and Higher Education, said: “Upholding the right to education requires protecting educational institutions and all their staff from attacks during times of conflicts. This protection can only be ensured through the presence of two essential elements: sanctions and punishment.“To that end, existing international conventions must be activated and their content enhanced to establish, through profound and serious reflection, an international mechanism, practical and operational, to prohibit attacks on the right to education, punishing the perpetrators and obliging them to offer an appropriate compensation for any human or material damage resulting from their actions”.291Key questions raised in and as a result of the ensuing debate included: What more needs to be done to ensure that perpetrators are actually investigated, tried and punished? Was the apparent widespread lack of progress on this issue due to gaps in the coverage of attacks on education by international law or the monitoring processes that can inform investigators? Should there be a campaign for a UN resolution?
