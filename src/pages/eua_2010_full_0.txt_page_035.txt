Some attacks may be focused directly on the education system. For instance, on 3 June 2009, eight police officers and two teachers were killed when a bomb blew up a convoy carrying examination papers near the Algerian capital, Algiers. Guarded by police, the convoy was carrying copies of the examination paper that pupils must pass to go to high school.49Worrying apparent new trends are the control of schools by narco-guerrillas or their occupation by security forces fighting them, in Brazil, for instance; and the abduction for ransom or killing, or both, of school children or teachers by armed criminal groups in Mexico, Haiti, India and Nepal, as well as by Islamic extremists in the Philippines.50 There are reports of education aid workers being targeted in some countries, although it is not known whether this merely reflects a trend towards targeting aid workers in general. The targeting of academics in Iraq remained high in 2007 but declined significantly thereafter. However, professors are still being assassinated. New research by the Institute of International Education suggests that the persecution of academics occurs in a wide number of countries but is significantly more likely to occur in poor, politically unstable, repressed or failed states in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa.51 Separately, analysis of the individual country reports prepared for Education under Attack 2010 (see Annex I) shows that in recent years students, teachers and academics have been either beaten, arrested, tortured, threatened with murder or shot dead by state forces or state-backed forces in Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, Honduras, Iran, Myanmar, Nepal, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, Zambia and Zimbabwe.52Scholar Rescue in the Modern World, the Institute of International Education’s survey of applicants and inquiries made to the US-based Scholar Rescue Fund (SRF), is the first attempt to provide a global report on the breadth and scope of scholar persecution around the world. It has inherent limitations, since its figures are based solely on inquiries and applications for its own support grants for relocating endangered
