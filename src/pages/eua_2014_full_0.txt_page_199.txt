
causing fear among teachers and schoolchildren by
threatening to set up torture bases on the premises.1785
In another, a militia base was set up at Chifamba
Primary School in Guruve South, Mashonaland Central
province, where militia members conducted night
patrols and political meetings and forced people to
attend Zanu-PF events.1786 In August 2011,
Zimbabwean human rights groups indicated that
some 200 youth militia members were being trained at
Sherenje Secondary School in Manicaland
province.1787 War veterans and the Simudza Makoni
youth group, allegedly linked to Zanu-PF politician
Didymus Mutasa, also reportedly seized control of
Rainbow Crèche in Rusape, forcing its staff to flee.1788

Attacks on higher education
Reports suggest that police and security forces used
excessive violence to quell student protests on several
occasions, resulting in at least two deaths and 641789
injuries.1790 For example, in September 2010, two
students reportedly died after being brutally assaulted
by security guards and ‘unknown assailants’ who
sought to prevent students with unpaid fees from
attending a graduation ceremony at Bindura
University. Sixteen other students were injured,
according to the Zimbabwe National Students’
Union.1791 In a separate incident, around 10 students
from Great Zimbabwe University were reportedly
beaten by police for pressing other students to join a
boycott of lectures.1792
The Student Solidarity Trust reported seven cases of
abduction and torture of university students from
January 2009 to July 2012.1793 In one incident, two
students were organizing a protest against high fees at
Masvingo Polytechnic when Central Intelligence
Organisation agents allegedly arrested and tortured
them. The students then had to pay an ‘admission of
guilt’ fine to be released.1794
At least one academic was reported to have been
tortured during detention by the Zimbabwean authorities. On 5 December 2012, a lecturer at Bindura
University was arrested, put in solitary confinement
and tortured for claiming in a research paper that
police had been ordered not to arrest Zanu-PF
members committing crimes during the 2008
conflict.1795

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

According to the SST, 359 students were unlawfully
arrested between January 2009 and July 2012 and 349
were unlawfully detained in the same period.1796 It is
not known how many of these cases overlap.
