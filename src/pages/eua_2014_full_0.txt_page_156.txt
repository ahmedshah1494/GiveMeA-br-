Liberation Army, the Myanmar army destroyed schools
as well as other properties when they shelled entire
villages. For instance, in early February 2010, 200
soldiers attacked K’Dee Mu Der village and destroyed
15 Karen homes, a middle school and a nursery
school;1129 in the same month, a high school and
nursery school in Thi Baw Tha Kwee Lah village tract
were destroyed by Myanmar light infantry
battalions;1130 and on 23 July 2010, government forces
shelled and then set alight 50 Karen homes, a school
and a church in Tha Dah Der, a predominantly
Christian village in northern Kayin state.1131 In Kachin
state, several schools were hit by artillery, although
the intention was unclear. In August 2011, it was
reported that Myanmar military forces had laid mines
close to a school in Myitkyina township to prevent the
Kachin Independence Army (KIA) from using it.1132

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Children have also been killed and injured in attacks.
On 19 February 2010, Myanmar army soldiers in
northern Kayin state allegedly killed a 15-year-old
student and injured two others when they fired a
mortar into a camp for internally displaced persons,
hitting a school during examinations. The Karen
Human Rights Group claimed the attack was deliberate.1133
In Kachin state, between June 2011 and January 2013,
at least two schools were targeted. Five children and
one teacher were seriously injured when the Myanmar
army fired on their school in Mansi township in August
2011.1134 On 13 November 2011, 11 young students were
killed and 27 injured in a drive-by motorcycle bomb
attack on a boarding school in the state capital,
Myitkyina.1135

Military use of schools
Myanmar soldiers have occupied educational
premises and forced teachers and students to work for
them, according to the Watchlist on Children and
Armed Conflict.1136 In May 2011, for example, the army
reportedly used village schools as barracks for two
weeks, causing some students not to return.1137
