
and regions.136 There is a good deal of media reporting
of such attacks but this study represents the first
attempt to report on the full range of attacks on higher
education globally. However, the methods for
continuing to report globally will need to be
strengthened over the coming years.

Accountability and ending impunity
The legal framework protecting education
Attacks on education may violate international human
rights law, international humanitarian law (also known
as the laws of war) or international criminal law,
depending on the context. Although these are distinct
legal regimes, they overlap and are increasingly interlinked. Each contains rules that protect education
explicitly, or protect the conditions necessary for
education provision, such as the protection of educational facilities and the lives of students and
education staff.137 The right to education is guaranteed
under international human rights law in both conflict
and non-conflict situations where states have ratified
the relevant treaties,138 with primary education to be
compulsory and available free to all and other levels of
education to be available and/or equally accessible to
all.139 Its protection is most effective, however, where
states have taken national measures to implement
these treaty provisions. States may also be bound by
human rights and other legal provisions through
customary international law, which applies to all
states regardless of whether they have ratified a
relevant treaty.
In situations of armed conflict, both international
human rights law and international humanitarian law
apply. The latter offers protections to students and
education staff under its general provision for
protecting civilians,140 and to education facilities
insofar as such property is civilian, is not a military
objective and its seizure or destruction is not justified
by imperative military necessity.141 Further, international humanitarian law seeks to protect the
educational needs of particularly vulnerable groups,
notably children, by ensuring that their education
continues uninterrupted during armed conflict.142 The
use of schools and universities in support of a military
effort is restricted under international humanitarian
law but not prohibited in all circumstances.143

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Under international criminal law, certain acts attract
individual criminal responsibility – for example, wilful
killing of civilians, torture, wanton destruction or
seizure of enemy property, and attacks on civilian
objects (including education facilities). Under the
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,144
there is a specific reference to the prohibition of intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated
to education provided they are not military objectives.145 Insofar as inhumane acts such as torture,
imprisonment and forced disappearance are part of a
widespread or systematic attack on a civilian
population (including students, scholars, and
teachers) – even where there is no nexus with armed
conflict – they may be considered crimes against
humanity and therefore prosecutable under international criminal law.146
National law may have even greater potential to deter
attacks than international law. National legislation is a
key piece of the legal framework, enabling domestic
enforcement of protections and prosecutions of
perpetrators. The incorporation into national law of,
for example, Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court would promise greater
deterrence and accountability as well as give more
visibility to the protection of education in law.
Comparatively few countries, however, have included
attacks on educational facilities as a crime within their
national criminal or military laws. According to the
Coalition for the International Criminal Court, 65
countries have enacted domestic legislation implementing the crimes contained in the Rome Statute,
while another 35 countries have some form of
advanced draft of implementing legislation.147
Some countries have also introduced legislation,
jurisprudence or military policies restricting, and in
some cases completely prohibiting, the military use of
schools or universities, although this injunction is not
always consistently enforced. Examples include
Argentina,148 Colombia,149 Ecuador,150 India,151
Ireland,152 the Philippines,153 Poland,154 South Sudan155
and the UK.156
In the Philippines, for example, the practice of military
use of schools has been explicitly banned under both
national legislation and military policy157 – although

incidents continue to be reported.158 A draft law was
also under consideration that would criminalize the
occupation of schools.159 Further legal measures to
address the problem of attacks have been proposed
by a bill that would increase the penalty for electionrelated violence and another that would make election
service voluntary for teachers and other citizens, since
violence against teachers and schools is frequently
connected with their use during elections.160 These are
promising steps for increasing accountability, though
their effectiveness will ultimately depend on the
extent to which they are enforced.
In order to promote greater protection of schools and
universities during armed conflict, GCPEA has worked
with a range of stakeholders to develop and promote
the Lucens Guidelines for Protecting Schools and
Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict,
international guidelines that urge all parties to armed
conflict not to use schools and universities for any
purpose in support of their military effort.161 These
guidelines respect international law as it stands, are
not legally binding in themselves and do not affect
existing obligations under international law. They also
reflect evidence of good practice already applied by
some parties to armed conflict to avoid impinging on
students’ safety and education. They are intended to
lead to a shift in behaviour that will contribute to
better protections for schools and universities in times
of armed conflict and, in particular, to a reduction in
their use by the fighting forces of parties to armed
conflict in support of the military effort.162 These guidelines are discussed further in this report in the essay
‘Military use of schools and universities: changing
behaviour’.
Strengthening accountability
It is clear that a strong legal framework for the right to
education and the protection of education exists,
even though there may be ways it can still be further
enhanced. However, impunity for those responsible
for attacking education is a persistent problem.
Accountability means, in its most basic sense,
ensuring there are adverse consequences for those
who perpetrate abuses.163 This is important for
purposes of justice, both as an end in itself and
because it can play a key role in peace-building by
