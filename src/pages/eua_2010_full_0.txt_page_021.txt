For most education attacks, the challenge is not how to ensure they are covered by law but how to create awareness that they are covered and how to build up pressure for the law to be respected and applied.Possible measures to take include: Referring more cases concerning perpetrators and commanders (who have known or ought to have known a war crime is taking place or failed to stop it taking place) to national prosecutors and where appropriate the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court;Researching and monitoring the effectiveness of accountability mechanisms in reducing impunity for education attacks;Training troops, officers and military lawyers in the laws of war and the conduct of troops in relation to protecting education from attack and protecting the right to education;Monitoring the compliance of officers and troops with national and international law in relation to protecting education from attack and protecting the right to education;Monitoring the disruption of the provision of education and fulfilment of the right to education by attacks on education, including the impact on the education system; and making the international community, military lawyers and parties to conflict more aware of the impact on victims, education systems, development and fragility;Entering into special agreements between parties to conflict not to attack education students, staff, personnel or buildings or their vicinity, educational processes such as exams, or other aspects of provision;Improving recognition of the value of education and the importance of protecting it via advocacy, the development of an internationally recognizable symbol denoting safe sanctuary status, public education on the human right to education and the laws of war, and better monitoring and reporting of attacks (as above);
