But it is also true that government policies on education in some situations are fuelling conflict and are at least part of the reason why schools are attacked. By contrast, the values of inclusive, transparent, culturally-sensitive education that promotes tolerance and understanding, as espoused in the 1966 Recommendation Concerning the Status of Teachers, remain crucial to educationâ€™s contribution to building peace.Progress on tackling the recruitment and use of child soldiers is welcomed, but there is a long way to go before an adequate international monitoring system is established for attacks on education or until a sufficient number of cases are tried to provide an adequate deterrent. The MRM on Children and Armed Conflict already allows monitoring not just of attacks on school buildings but of the killing of students, teachers and other education staff. It is a question of galvanizing education-oriented organizations to become monitoring partners, help gather that information, and use it not only to strengthen accountability but also to improve prevention and response. Attacks on education must be included as a trigger for listing by the Security Council with the added requirement of producing time-bound action plans.Beyond, but including, the contribution of the MRM, a truly global system of monitoring attacks on the full range of education targets as defined in this study must be developed.Evidence from research suggests that hard security measures alone may not deter attacks. Much greater effort needs to be put into researching why perpetrators carry out attacks on education and what scope there is for negotiating to protect schools and universities as safe sanctuaries.More research is also needed on the progress of countries in criminalizing attacks and investigating and prosecuting perpetrators. The fact that many countries have not done so to date may be due largely to lack of awareness either of attacks or of the significance of their impact on education.
