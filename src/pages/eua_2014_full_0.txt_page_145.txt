
denial of access to education or a threat to deny
access. A school in Khirbet Tana, near Nablus, was
demolished in 2010 for the sixth time by Israeli forces.
In Dkaika village, South Hebron, another was partially
demolished in 2011.959 In 2012, Israeli authorities
issued demolition orders against three Palestinian
schools in Area C and East Jerusalem for being built
without a permit.960 On 14 May 2012, Haaretz reported
that a Palestinian elementary school was shut down
after Israel’s Civil Administration confiscated the
vehicle used to transport teachers to it. The school
also had a demolition order against it, although the
nearest alternative school was 20 kilometres away.961

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
In southern Israel, in April 2011, an anti-tank missile
fired from the Gaza Strip struck a school bus, killing a
16-year-old boy and injuring the driver.962 It was not
possible to ascertain if it was targeted.963
Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the AlQassam Brigades, an armed wing of Hamas.964
In the West Bank, schoolchildren, teachers and other
personnel faced intimidation by Israeli settlers and
military forces. Out of 101 communities surveyed by
the Education Cluster and the Child Protection
Working Group in 2011, 28 experienced settler
violence against students and teachers and 26 experienced threats against them.965 In one case, at Qartaba
School in Hebron, there were reports of pupils and
staff being harassed or threatened. In October 2011, a
guard at the school was allegedly assaulted by a group
of settlers after he tried to stop them from throwing
glass and empty bottles at the building.966 In
December 2011, according to Ma’an News Agency,
settlers allegedly tried to stab a sixth-grade pupil at
the school and hit another who tried to defend him,
while Israeli soldiers allegedly looked on without
intervening.967 During the incident at a Palestinian
school in Urif in April 2012 (mentioned earlier in the
Attacks on schools section), in addition to throwing
objects at schools, Israeli settlers physically assaulted
children inside schools and on their way to and from
school.968

Working Group survey also reported that schoolchildren, youth and teachers experienced Israeli
military harassment or violence while en route to and
from school, and 31 per cent indicated that students
and teachers had to cross at least one military checkpoint to reach their schools, which affected more than
2,500 children each day.969 Sixteen per cent of
children in the communities surveyed claimed to have
experienced delays and harassment by military and
security personnel while crossing these checkpoints
or the separation barrier.970

Military use of schools

year-old university student from Tulkarem city because
of his graduate research project on the construction of
a pilotless plane, which they said posed a threat to
Israel’s national security.979 One academic who called
for a one-state solution was detained without charge
by the Israeli authorities in 2011 and was still being
held two years later.980At least nine academics and
university staff were reportedly detained981 by the
Palestinian Authority – including eight from An-Najah
University accused of being affiliated with Hamas and
attempting to start a new university in the West
Bank.982

The UN found evidence of the military use of schools in
the West Bank in 2011 and 2012. For example, in March
2011, the Israeli military used a school in the village of
Awarta as a detention and interrogation centre for two
weeks after five members of an Israeli family were
killed, allegedly by Palestinian youths. 971 In April 2011,
Israeli forces broke into a Nablus school and went on
the roof to provide security to a nearby area that
settlers were visiting at night.972 In 2012, there were
two incidents of schools being occupied by the IDF.973
In one of the incidents, according to the International
Middle East Media Centre, Israeli soldiers used a
school east of Jenin city as a military post and
monitoring tower in November 2012.974

Palestinian students and professors experienced
restrictions on movement that negatively impacted
their educational activities, including a blanket Israeli
ban on travel for Gazan students and professors to
study or lecture at Palestinian universities in the West
Bank. In October 2009, the Palestinian interior
ministry and an NGO campaigning for freedom of
movement reported that 838 Gazan students who
were formally offered places and/or enrolled at foreign
universities were unable to leave Gaza because of
travel restrictions and bureaucracy.983 Hamas also
barred seven students from travelling to the United
States for a year of study under a US programme, citing
worries over their supervision.984

Attacks on higher education

Attacks on education in 2013

Higher education was affected by similar violence. In
Gaza, during Operation Cast Lead, 14 of the 15 higher
education institutions were damaged, with six directly
targeted, according to the Al Mezan Centre for Human
Rights in Gaza. Three colleges and six university
buildings were fully destroyed. The total damage was
estimated at USD 21.1 million.975 Seven universities in
Gaza were also damaged during Israeli airstrikes in
November 2012.976

A wide range of types of attack on education
continued to be reported in 2013. These included
demolition orders against primary and secondary
schools in East Jerusalem and the West Bank,985
settlers stoning schools and students986 and school
buses carrying students,987 acts of intimidation by
settlers, the use of tear gas in and near Palestinian
schools by Israeli police, and shootings of students by
Israeli soldiers.988 Police found military weapons and
explosives stashed in two schools in Israel.989 There
were also reports that the Ministry of Education in
Gaza was organizing military-style training for school
children aged 15-17, with training provided by the
Hamas National Guard and militants with Hamas’s
armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, and that the
Prime Minister was planning to extend it to 12-yearolds.990

University students and faculty were injured or
arrested by Palestinian and Israeli forces. In one
incident, Gazan police entered the campus of Al-Azhar
University in Gaza and attacked protesting students,
allegedly beating them with clubs.977 According to
media and human rights reports, Israeli security forces
arrested 20 university students from 2009 to 2012.978
For example, Israeli forces reportedly detained a 20-
