
5,000 anti-government protesters.485 The University of
Bahrain and Bahrain Polytechnic subsequently
suspended classes until mid-May and late April
respectively.486
According to the BICI report, 73 students were arrested
or detained after February 2011 and some were
imprisoned for more than three months.487 Security
forces also questioned at least 15 professors from
three universities for several hours before releasing
them without charge, and detained one for over four
months, Human Rights Watch reported.488 One
professor said he was detained with 10 other
colleagues on suspicion of having participated in
protests – and that Interior Ministry officials went to
the university and ordered them to report to a police
station, where they were blindfolded, interrogated
and beaten before being released.489
During 2011, the government also dismissed
professors and suspended or expelled hundreds of
university students for participation in demonstrations and political activities. At the University of
Bahrain, students not charged with violent crimes
were reinstated but were required to sign loyalty
pledges and received warnings not to engage in
political activity on campus.490 Of those charged with
crimes, at least six were sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.491 The University of Bahrain also dismissed 19
academics on charges that included participation in
protests;492 by the end of 2012, they had all been
reinstated.493
Prior to the 2011 events, there was one reported
incident concerning an academic. Dr Abduljalil alSingace, a professor of engineering at the University of
Bahrain, was detained in 2010 after speaking about
the country’s human rights practices during a seminar
at the UK House of Lords.494 His lawyer reported that
during detention, al-Singace was deprived of sleep
and the crutches and wheelchair he relied upon,
subjected to physical violence that resulted in a partial
loss of hearing and denied medical treatment.495 In
June 2011, a military court sentenced him to life in
prison, a decision the Supreme Court upheld in
January 2013.496

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Attacks on education in 2013
On 16 April, police raided the Jabreya Secondary
School for Boys in Manama, firing tear gas and
clashing with students who were peacefully
demanding the release of one of their classmates,
arrested from the school the previous day.497 Injuries
among students were reported and one was allegedly
arrested at the scene.498

CeNTRAL AFRICAN RePUBLIC
Most attacks took place after the Séléka rebellion in
late 2012 and during 2013. More than 100 schools were
damaged, destroyed or looted, two dozen were used for
military purposes and there were reports of students
and teachers being killed. By early 2013, one in two
schools had closed.

Context
The Central African Republic (CAR) has experienced
decades of political unrest, including two conflicts in
the past ten years and ongoing violence, particularly in
the north.499 Various armed rebel groups, including the
Popular Army for the Restoration of the Republic and of
Democracy (APRD), the Union of Democratic Forces for
Unity (UFDR), and the Convention of Patriots for Justice
and Peace (CPJP), fought government forces between
2004 and 2011.500 The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a
rebel group originally from Uganda, spread its operations into south-east CAR after 2008.501
In late 2012, renewed conflict broke out when a group
of rebel forces known as Séléka (meaning ‘coalition’ in
Sango), comprised primarily of UFDR and CPJP dissidents and members of the Patriotic Convention for the
Salvation of Kodro (CPSK), accused President François
Bozizé’s government of failing to abide by previous
peace agreements.502 Séléka’s military campaign from
the north to the capital Bangui in the south-west
culminated in a coup d’état on 24 March 2013 and the
formation of a new transitional government.503
However, for months after the coup, law and order
broke down and Séléka forces committed serious
human rights abuses against civilians.504 In October
2013, a UN Security Council Resolution was unanimously approved to deploy an African Union (AU)
peacekeeping force and to support a possible UN

peacekeeping mission.505 By early December 2013,
amid escalating violence, French troops were
additionally deployed to CAR after the Security Council
authorized their temporary intervention and the use of
‘all necessary measures’ to support the AU-led peacekeeping force in protecting civilians and restoring
order.506
The education system suffered as teachers and
students were displaced and schools were shut,
damaged or destroyed.507 By April 2013, nearly half of
CAR’s schools had closed508 and more than 650,000
children were out of school.509
Net enrolment at primary level was estimated at 69 per
cent in 2011, and 14 per cent at secondary level, while
gross tertiary enrolment was only 3 per cent. The
estimated adult literacy rate was 57 per cent.510 In the
northern conflict-affected regions, net primary
enrolment was only 48 per cent in 2012.511

Attacks on schools
No attacks on or looting of infrastructure were
reported in 2009 or 2010 but due to fear of fighting in
the eastern part of the country, including LRA raids,
parents kept many students out of school.512 In 2011,
according to the UN, 12 schools were used, attacked or
destroyed in fighting between CPJP, UFDR and FPR.513 In
2012, fewer attacks were reported on schools and
hospitals than in 2011.514

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Teachers were abducted and killed in 2010, but it was
not clear whether this was related to their work.515
In 2011, the UN reported teachers in Bria, the capital of
Haute-Kotto prefecture, being assaulted by armed
groups because their schools were in areas under the
control of rival groups.516

Military use of schools
CPJP elements used schools in villages in Haute-Kotto
between May and July 2010,517 while in 2011, more
were used during confrontations between CPJP and
UFDR, as well as during attacks by the Chadian rebel
group the Popular Front for Recovery (FPR).518 In
January 2012, a Chadian army helicopter landed on a
school in Ouadango (Nana Grébizi prefecture),
