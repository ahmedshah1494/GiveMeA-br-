the recruitment campaign focused on teenagers in
grades 8 to 12 on the grounds that they would be
easier to influence than adult recruits.1737 Muhammad
Ezan, a political analyst, noted that students and
teachers were used as Houthi recruiters in Sa’ada. He
added that there was no evidence of forcible
recruitment or abduction.1738

According to University World News, pro-government
gunmen killed or injured students protesting near the
university,1746 and clashes erupted in front of the
university between students and youths and
government supporters armed with daggers and
batons.1747

Attacks on higher education

There were at least two cases of the use of higher
education facilities by combatants. The First Armoured
Division rebel forces occupied Sana’a University’s Old
Campus in 2011. The university was closed from
February 2011 until January 2012 when the first
students started to return, but the rebels remained on
campus, even using the cafeteria, until April 2012.1748
From early June to December 2011, Central Security
forces and Republican Guards occupied the Superior
Institute for Health Science in Ta’izz, a college for
pharmacists and physicians’ assistants that was
located on high ground.1749

Attacks on higher education facilities
There was one reported direct attack on a higher
education institution during 2009-2012. On 27
November 2011, Houthi rebels reportedly killed 20
people and wounded 70 others in an attack on a Sunni
Islamist school in northern Yemen.1739 The school, Dar
al-Hadith, an institute for Islamic Salafi teachings,
trained Sunni preachers in the Houthi stronghold of
Dammaj, Sa’ada governorate. One teacher speculated
that the attack was motivated by a fear of Sunnis
converting Shias in the area.1740 It was reported by the
Switzerland-based human rights NGO Alkarama that
the centre was under siege for two weeks before the
attack, preventing the delivery of food and medical
supplies.1741 One 18-year-old student was shot on 4
November 2011 while playing football with colleagues
in the institute’s courtyard.1742
At Sana’a University, students with opposed political
stances forcibly shut down their rivals’ classes in
March 2011.1743
Attacks on higher education students, academics
and personnel
Between February and October 2011, 73 higher
education students were killed nationally and 139
wounded, 38 of whom were permanently disabled as a
result of their injuries, according to the Wafa
Organization for Martyrs’ Families and Wounded
Care.1744 It is not known how many of these killings and
injuries occurred on campus or in the vicinity of universities, or because the victims were being targeted as
students. However, the Yemen Students Union
reported that there were some deaths and high
numbers of injuries from gunshot wounds among the
students camped in Change Square, in front of Sana’a
University’s entrance, who were boycotting lectures as
part of a protest demanding a change of president.1745
