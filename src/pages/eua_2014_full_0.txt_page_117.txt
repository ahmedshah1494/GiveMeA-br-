Attacks on schools
At least two schools were directly targeted. In one
case, a school was attacked both by armed groups and
armed forces. In February 2010, for instance, FARC
combatants forced their way into a rural school in
Nariño department during a meeting of the indigenous
community, according to the UN. The Colombian
armed forces attacked the FARC members inside the
school. Suspected of collusion with the enemy by both
sides, 300 members of the indigenous community
reportedly fled.536 In the other case, in June 2010, a
bomb blew up in a school in rural Cauca, allegedly
targeting Colombian military forces while they were
inside it.537
The International Committee of the Red Cross registered five incidents of education facilities destroyed in
hostilities and 10 more affected by nearby explosives
and ordnance from 2009 to 2012.538
The UN reported three incidents of mines left near
schools during the reporting period. For example, in
Valle del Cauca, the FARC left behind mines after using
a school as a shield, causing lessons to be suspended
for six months.539 A 2012 Watchlist on Children and
Armed Conflict report also warned that guerrillas were
increasingly planting landmines without a record of
their location, preventing children from walking to
school.540

According to teachers’ union FECODE, the number of
its members killed remained steady for the first three
years of the reporting period (27 in 2009, 27 in 2010,
21 in 2011), then dropped to 13 in 2012.541 The Escuela
Nacional Sindical (ENS), a prominent Colombian NGO
monitoring labour rights, reported 21 murders of
unionized teachers in 2009, 28 in 2010, 16 in 2011 and
just four in 2012.542 The Ministry of Education’s
