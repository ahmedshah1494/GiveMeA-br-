According to Federación Colombiana de Educadores (Fecode): “The threats, displacements, disappearances, deaths of hundreds of teachers are a result of [teachers’] opposition to the forced recruitment of children and youths by armed groups and their positions of leadership in unions, education and the community, and because they are accused by one or another illegal armed group of collaborating with the opposition.”Morales said he started as the only teacher in a school for 45 children aged 5 to 12 in Arauca. He became politically active when he could not accept that foreign oil companies were taking 400 barrels a day from an area right next to his school, yet he had to teach under a leaky palm leaf roof in a wooden building with an earth ﬂ oor and no sanitation, no water and no textbooks.Teachers in Colombia are often social leaders who get to know the problems of peasant farmers and their families, and do something about them, putting forward requests and petitions to the multinationals, Morales said. But that can make them a target for political assassination by paramilitary groups that protect the big ﬁ rms’ interests.He had a thick dossier of death threats received by himself and his colleagues. One sent to the president of the teachers’ association in Arauca said: “Look after your children or you won’t see them again.”Under a protection programme that the government was obliged by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to set up, the nine out of ten teachers who are trade union members are given a printed checklist of security measures.They are told to: always check to see if your car is being followed  never sit in a public place with your back to the front door  always be aware of your escape routes from any situation  if you carry a weapon, make sure it is ready to ﬁ re.  This did not help Morales when he was arrested along with Raquel Castro, a member of the Teachers’ Association of Arauca, on 5 August 2004. Both were charged with “rebellion”. The army burst through the door at a meeting they were attending and killed three other trade unionists present. Hector Alirio Martinez, Leonel Goyeneche
