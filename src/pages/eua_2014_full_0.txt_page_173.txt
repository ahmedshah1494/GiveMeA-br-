
While the exact numbers of children recruited are not
known, the UN indicated that Al-Shabaab abducted an
estimated 2,000 children for military training in
2010.1402 At least another 948 children were recruited
in 2011, mainly by Al-Shabaab and mostly from
schools and madrassas.1403 Human Rights Watch
reported that it had interviewed 23 Somali children
recruited or abducted by Al-Shabaab in 2010 and
2011; 14 had been taken from schools or while en
route, which gives some indication of the extent to
which schools were ready sites for forced recruitment
and abduction.1404 Of the 79 attacks on education
recorded by the UN from January 2011 to December
2012, 21 involved the recruitment of 244 children (21
girls and 223 boys) from schools by anti-government
elements.1405
Teachers and school managers also received orders
from Al-Shabaab and other armed groups to enlist
students or release them for training.1406 The UN
reported that in June 2010 alone, Al-Shabaab ordered
teachers and school managers in Lower Shabelle to
release more than 300 students to be trained, threatening punishment for failure to comply.1407 In October
2011, Al-Shabaab was reported to have closed two of
the biggest schools in the capital of the lower Shabelle
region after the head teachers refused to recruit
students to fight.1408 In May 2011, the UN reported the
murder of a teacher in the Hiraan region by Al-Shabaab
for having objected to child recruitment.1409 In
February 2012, five teachers were reportedly arrested

for failing to enlist their students in military
training.1410
Human Rights Watch research in Somalia found
evidence of girls being taken from schools and forced
to become ‘wives’ of Al-Shabaab fighters. In one case,
the girls were selected at gunpoint; one who refused
to be taken was shot in front of her classmates. In
another, after 12 girls were taken by Al-Shabaab, the
teacher reported that some 150 female students
dropped out of school.1411 He also reported that a 16year-old girl who was taken was beheaded and her
head was brought back and shown to the remaining
girls at the school as a warning because she had
refused to marry a fighter much older than she was.1412

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education facilities
Bombs and mortar fire damaged at least two universities, in one case killing university personnel. For
example, Al-Shabaab allegedly destroyed a Sufi
Muslim university in central Somalia in 2009.1413 In
March 2011, a mortar hit a Somali University building
in the Bar Ubah neighbourhood of Mogadishu, killing
a university lecturer, wounding two security guards
and destroying a section of lecture halls. It is unclear
whether the attack was intentional.1414 In October
2011, a bomb exploded at Gaheyr University, targeting
TFG/AMISOM troops based there. In November 2011, a
bomb left in the middle of the road in the vicinity of the
university also exploded.1415
Attacks on higher education students, academics and
personnel
At least one attack on higher education students and
personnel was reported. In December 2009, a male
suicide bomber disguised as a veiled woman blew
himself up during a Benadir University medical school
graduation ceremony in Mogadishu, killing 22 people
including the ministers of education, higher education
and health, the dean of the medical school,
professors, students and their relatives, and
wounding at least 60 more.1416 Though suspected, AlShabaab denied having committed the attack.1417

Military use of higher education facilities
Reports indicate that armed groups, AMISOM and
government troops also used university campuses,
particularly during the 2012 military campaigns that
drove Al-Shabaab out of several of their urban strongholds. In January 2012, after a heavy gun battle,
AMISOM troops succeeded in forcing Al-Shabaab out
of its positions in and around the buildings of
Mogadishu University, among several other key areas
in the northern outskirts of Mogadishu.1418 In
September 2012, AMISOM and Somali National Army
troops captured Kismayo University in the northern
part of Kismayo during an operation to take control of
the city and used it as a temporary military base for
nearly a month.1419 Gaheyr University was reported to
have been serving as an AMISOM base in 2011,1420
while Ethiopian troops used Hiraan University as a
military base in early 2012, forcing the university to set
up a makeshift campus inside the town of
Beletweyne.1421

Attacks on education in 2013
The number of attacks reported to the UN during the
period from January to September was lower in
comparison to the same period in 2012, most likely
due to lower general levels of conflict.1422 As of
September, a total of 42 attacks on education had
been reported compared with 63 attacks during the
same period of the previous year.1423 Almost half of
these attacks occurred in the Benadir region and many
were associated with security operations conducted
by government security forces while searching for AlShabaab elements.1424
In January, AMISOM troops were alleged to have fired
mistakenly on a religious school in a village 120
kilometres west of Mogadishu while pursuing
militants, killing five children under the age of 10.1425 In
March, two children died and three more were injured
when a student unwittingly triggered an IED at a
Koranic school in Heraale, Galgadud region.1426
