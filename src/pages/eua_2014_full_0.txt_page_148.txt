Context
Libya’s conflict began in February 2011 when protests
in Benghazi against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s
regime were crushed by security forces firing on the
crowd. This led to a rapid escalation between forces
loyal to Gaddafi and those seeking political and social
change. In March 2011, a NATO coalition intervened
with an air campaign following UN Security Council
Resolution 1973 and on 16 September 2011, the UN
recognized the National Transitional Council (NTC) as
the legal representative of Libya. The following month,
on 20 October 2011, Gaddafi was captured and subsequently killed by rebels.1016
In total, more than 1,900 schools were damaged
during the 2011 uprising,1017 of which 476 sustained
heavy damage and 19 were completely destroyed.1018 It
is not known how many of these were intentionally
targeted.
Fighting in 2011 caused extensive damage to universities in Misrata, while in June 2011, the Libyan
government said NATO bombing in Tripoli had
damaged university buildings.1019
A nationwide school-based survey, reporting conflictrelated causes of drop-out, indicated that a total of
338 pupils had been killed, 268 injured and 48
disabled during the war in 2011.1020
