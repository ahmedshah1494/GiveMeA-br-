But the onus is also on governments to criminalize attacks on education. Radhika Coomaraswamy, UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, argues that ensuring that national legislation relating to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes makes these crimes punishable under national law, with the same scope and definition as the Rome Statute, would be an important step towards addressing the prevailing culture of impunity on all grave violations against children.The Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is an important vehicle for encouraging prosecutions for attacks on education for two reasons: First, because the Rome Statute classifies as war crimes the conscription, enlistment or use in hostilities of children under 15; grave acts of sexual violence; and attacks on hospitals and schools, and the ICC is already carrying out investigations into crimes concerning attacks on education as defined by this study in six out of the eight cases it has taken up.Second, although the ICC tries cases only when states are unwilling or unable to do so in line with their responsibility to prevent and punish atrocities, the ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor takes a pro-active stance against impunity – using its influence within national and international networks to encourage and provide support for genuine national proceedings where possible.A useful objective for those concerned with attacks on education might therefore be to encourage ICC or national court investigations in the most high-profile situations, where attacks on schools and teachers are well publicized and the perpetrators have made public their intention to attack schools via published threats and orders (as is the case in the targeting of schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan by the Taliban, and in India by the Communist Party of India-Maoist). Evidence needs to be gathered and pressure put upon international and national courts to investigate more cases. The starting point should be a sustained international campaign of awareness-raising and advocacy to ensure that education attacks, including attacks on higher education, are effectively monitored, investigated and addressed through the courts.
