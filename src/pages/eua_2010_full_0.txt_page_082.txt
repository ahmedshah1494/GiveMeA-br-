Targeted assassinations, forced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, torture and beatings, and threats of any of these, can have a stark impact on the ability and motivation of teachers, trade unionists, academics and officials to carry out their jobs, leading to a degrading of education quality in affected areas.Governments may struggle to recruit teachers in areas where they are targeted for assassination, for example. If the problem continues over a number of years, this could have serious consequences for the quality and numbers of teachers recruited.In higher education, attacks on academics who research or teach particular subjects – whether contested history, human rights or HIV & AIDS, for instance - will limit curricula, restrict new thinking and hinder development. Attacks on aid workers can lead to their removal from a particular area or even the whole country, with the loss of the expertise and supplies that come with them. In Afghanistan in 2009, UNICEF’s work as the lead agency supporting education was inhibited by the fact that UN staff were only authorized to work in half the country for security reasons, so work in other provinces had to be carried out by proxy through local NGOs.“The impact of attacks is greater in developing countries, because they have fewer resources to counteract the attacks, or for recovery. There’s less capacity,” says Eastman. “But if the attacks are repeated there is also the psychological effect of less impetus to do the repairs – some governments will feel they are hitting their heads against a brick wall – and a whole generation of children can lose the opportunity for education”.184Educational reverses fuel conflictThe loss of schooling can drive pupils down an alternative path. In some conflicts, out-of-school children are a target for recruitment for use in combat or forced labour by armed groups, security forces and criminal gangs.It is commonly argued by proponents of providing education in emergencies that it is vital to establish schooling as quickly as possible for communities and individuals affected by conflict because it provides stability, an investment in the future and a
