The question may stem from the lack of prosecutions of, or reports on, attacks on schools in the Secretary-General’s reports on children and armed conflict (although coverage has increased in the most recent report). How close does “attacks on schools” come to the definition used in this study? For instance, does it include students, teachers, school support staff, education officials, education trade unionists and education aid workers?The minimum data set that the OSRSG-CAAC seeks from MRM Task Forces asks for nine categories of information in relation to attacks on schools and hospitals, including answers to the following question: “Consequences of attack?
