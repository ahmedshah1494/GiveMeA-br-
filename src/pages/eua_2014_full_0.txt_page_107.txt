reopened in 2002. In 2009, for example, more than 70
per cent of schools in Helmand province and more
than 80 per cent in Zabul province were closed.398 In
May 2012, the Ministry of Education reported that
more than 590 schools were closed in areas at risk,
mostly in Helmand, Zabul and Kandahar provinces.399
As of 2011,400 gross primary enrolment401 was 97 per
cent, gross secondary enrolment was 52 per cent and
gross tertiary enrolment was 4 per cent.402 Net attendance was only 66 per cent for boys and 40 per cent for
girls at primary school level, and 18 per cent for boys

Attacks on schools
Types of attacks on schools included the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), landmines and suicide
bombs in or around school buildings, rocket attacks,
grenades thrown into school playgrounds or facilities,

2008, with attacks on schools increasing in areas
around Kabul and in the east, including in the
provinces of Wardak, Logar, Khost, Laghman, Kunar
and Nangarhar.405 For instance, unknown armed men
used dynamite to blast a high school in Nadir Shahkot
district of Khost province in May 2009, destroying 18
classrooms.406 However, the number of incidents
dropped to 197 in 2010. There were spikes in the
number of attacks in September 2010, at the time of
the parliamentary elections, just as there were during
the 2009 presidential elections, when schools were
used as polling stations.407 But the number fell to 167
in 2012. (There were at least 133 attacks on schools or
school-related victims in 2011, but the UN report did
not clarify how many other of the 185 incidents of
attacks on schools and hospitals were attacks on
