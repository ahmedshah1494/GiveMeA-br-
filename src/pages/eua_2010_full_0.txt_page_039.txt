However, in a complex conflict in remote and dangerous areas such as eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo – where rival guerrilla groups CNDP and the LRA are fighting the army, access is difficult and NGOs have other urgent priorities – it may be hard to keep track of education incidents and their impacts. Where there is scant media coverage and NGOs do not have a systematic information-gathering system, they may rely on local officials and ordinary people voluntarily and randomly passing on information, and may simply not hear about some incidents. Since fighting frequently displaces groups of people, witnesses may have left affected areas to find safety.In Goma, for example, information typically reaches UNICEF via informal channels, for instance from education officials, local leaders and NGOs mentioning incidents at meetings about other issues. “We are very sure there are other cases [of attacks on education], but in education we don’t have a mechanism to systematically document it,” Sayo Aoki, a former UNICEF education specialist in Goma, said.58In addition, people tend to pass on information to NGOs and UN agencies only if they think it is going to be acted upon. This might explain why there is much more information about attacks in Afghanistan, where the problem is well known and the government and NGOs are involved in supporting protection and recovery measures, than in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.In many situations there is another problem: organizations often do not consistently monitor attacks on education because they have not been asked to do so.The increased targeting of aid workers in general and education aid workers in particular, as well as the banning or limiting of NGO work in some areas by governments (as occurred in northern Sri Lanka, for example, during 2008 and 2009), can make the collection of information very difficult. In Afghanistan, for instance, by the beginning
