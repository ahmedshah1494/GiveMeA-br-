Across the country, 22,000 students were reported abducted between 2002 and 2006; 1,264 received threats; 368 suffered beatings; 1,730 were arrested or tortured; and 126 disappeared.199“Thousands of children [in western Nepal] who witnessed and were victims of the violence, torture and killings are unable to overcome their worst experiences and need help,” CVICT’s psychosocial trainer, Tilak Manandhar, told IRIN in Bardiya District, in mid-western Nepal.200
