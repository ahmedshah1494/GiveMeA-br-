
These responses may be generated and implemented
by communities with little or no external support in
some instances. In other cases, they may be developed
and managed by communities in consultation with, or
with technical or financial support from, external
organizations or government partners. Different forms
of engagement may be more or less feasible
depending on the context, the nature of attacks and
community values with regard to education.
For example, in DRC in 2012, Education Cluster
partners worked at school level with students,
teachers and parents to analyse risks, including
protection-related threats resulting from conflict and
insecurity, and to develop risk reduction plans.195 In
Myanmar, local organizations and communities
developed systems for monitoring, negotiating with
armed groups and providing physical protection.196 In
Palestine, UNESCO helped to support the establishment of an alert system via text messages on
mobile phones, building on the initiative of parents
who call teachers in the morning to ensure that school
routes are safe. The system helps warn students,
teachers and parents when and where incidents are
occurring.197
Knowledge of the comparative effectiveness of
different types of community response remains
limited. It is generally accepted that community
involvement is a critical component for improving the
protection of education.198 However, more research is
needed on what makes community-level interventions
effective and their long-term impact. This issue is
explored further in the essay: ‘The role of communities
in protecting education’ later in this study.

Education policy and planning
In areas where there are persistent attacks, education
ministries and departments can take steps to help
prevent future incidents, reduce the impact of ongoing
attacks and ensure affected schools recover in a
timely way. When rebuilding, rehabilitation and
resupply work is slow, it can lengthen the denial of
access to good quality education by years. If curricula,
teacher recruitment policies or resource allocation are
a source of tension, failing to address them may mean
that attacks continue or recur. Conflict-sensitive
education policy and planning measures that take into

account the need to both prevent attacks on
education and respond to attacks where they do occur
are therefore critical to improving protection.
Strengthening the elements of education for peaceful
resolution of conflicts, respect for human rights and
responsible citizenship in the curriculum may also
help reduce the recurrence of conflict and build peace.
One important aspect of educational planning in
ensuring the recovery of the education system is
making funds and other resources available to rebuild
and repair schools. Every year that passes without a
school being rehabilitated and reopened can mean a
lost year of education for its students. But rehabilitating schools where large numbers have been
destroyed, as in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, is
a very heavy burden that may require sustained, largescale collaboration with international donors and
NGOs to fill gaps in funding. Investment on this scale
is only possible where attacks have been halted,
which requires intervention to avert or deter attacks
and resolve conflict over education issues.199
Where unequal access to quality education is a source
of tension, as was the case in Sierra Leone, establishing fair and transparent criteria for allocating
resources may be an important contributor to ending
grievances that can lead to attacks.200 Transparency in
education system governance and resource allocation
is also vital for restoring trust. In Nepal, for instance,
after years of unequal distribution of education
resources, the government tried to ensure resources
went to where they were really needed within conflictaffected areas by introducing district-level
micro-planning.201 It also sought to improve governance and transparency by encouraging parental
involvement in school management via PTAs, making
school governance bodies more inclusive and introducing fiscal audits.202
Curriculum reform, changes to teacher recruitment
and management, and increased community
involvement that seeks to address the grievances of
particular groups may also help to prevent attacks
motivated by perceived bias or the imposition of alien
cultural values, history, religion or language. In Nepal,
the latest editions of social studies textbooks now
include education for human rights, peace and

civics.203 Moreover, the provincial education authorities in the southernmost provinces of Thailand
decided that protection against attacks on schools
and assassinations of teachers could be increased by
changes to education curriculum and staffing policies
and practices. The southern provincial education
offices have instituted a number of policies to improve
protection for teachers and schools, including:
• increasing by five-fold the hours of Islamic
religious instruction in the four provinces where
the ethnic Malay Muslim population is concentrated or predominates and switching from five
to six days a week of schooling to accommodate the extra lessons;
• teaching English, the Malay language and the
local Muslim population’s tribal language;
• funding projects that build relationships with
the local community such as vegetable gardens
for the school;
• transferring Thai Buddhist teachers to city areas
which are safer, supported by subsidies to
cover the extra cost of additional travel to
school;
• recruiting more than 3,000 teachers from the
local community to replace teachers transferred
to other parts of the country;
• requiring students to study at home when
access to school is limited, with community
teachers visiting their homes.204
The aim of these policies is to build relationships and
trust with the local community and encourage them to
protect teachers, students and schools, although it is
difficult to say whether they have affected the number
of attacks.205
The Inter-Agency Network for Education in
Emergencies (INEE), UN agencies and a number of
donors are also increasingly focusing on education
policies and sector plans, as well as NGO and UN
programming that are conflict-sensitive and anticipate
and respond to some of the causes of armed conflict
and associated attacks. The INEE Guiding Principles
on Integrating Conflict Sensitivity in Education Policy
and Programming in Conflict-Affected and Fragile
Contexts were adopted at a high-level meeting
