written in response to a televised interview by
Princess Chulabhorn.1641
Two professors were also threatened due to their
attempts to reform lèse majesté laws. Pavin
Chachavalpongpun, an associate professor at Kyoto
University, has led a campaign from outside Thailand
to modify Article 112 of the laws. On 12 June 2012, he
received two anonymous phone calls from Thailand
threatening him if he continued the campaign.1642
Worachet Pakeerut, an assistant professor of law at
Thammasat University and member of a group of law
professors that has campaigned to liberalize lèse
majesté laws, was assaulted by two men outside his
university in March 2012.1643
Three student leaders, including the secretary-general
of the Student Federation of Thailand, were
summoned and interrogated by the CRES on 2 May
2010 and were questioned about their political
leanings and acquaintances.1644

Attacks on education in 2013
Attacks on teachers, education staff and soldiers
protecting schools continued in 2013. On 17 January, a
school minivan driver was killed by shots to his head
and torso by two men riding a motorcycle. The attack
happened while he was taking seven students to
kindergarten.1645 On 23 January, two militants walked
into a Narathiwat school dining hall and shot dead a
teacher in front of dozens of students.1646
In February 2013, the government and insurgents
agreed to begin peace talks and in July they
announced a 40-day ceasefire during Ramadan,1647
although this did not prevent further abuses against
civilians by suspected militants. On 29 April, it was
reported that a teacher and another man on security
duty at Buke Bakong School in Narathiwat were
injured when militants opened fire on them;1648 and on
24 July, two Muslim teachers were killed and one
seriously injured when the car they were travelling to
school in was blown up.1649 On 21 August, a teacher
was killed by gunfire while on his way home, resulting
in the temporary closure of 12 schools.1650
Separatist bomb, arson, gun and grenade attacks,

continued with frequency.1651 Often they had fatal
consequences for the soldiers protecting schools.1652
Atypically, in what may have been a revenge attack, an
Islamic religious teacher who worked at an Islamic
school, and who had overseen Islamic elementary
schools based in villages for four years, was shot and
killed by men riding a motorcycle in Pattani. It was not
known who killed him1653 but Human Rights Watch,
citing his case, urged the government to investigate
the murders of ethnic Malays to allay fears of state
inaction over perceived reprisal attacks.1654

headscarves in the civil service, including for teachers
in schools and universities, a contentious issue
between secularists and advocates of religious
freedom, would be lifted.1660
Net primary enrolment was 96 per cent, net secondary
enrolment was 85 per cent, and gross tertiary
enrolment was 61 per cent (2011). Adult literacy was 91
per cent (2009).1661

Attacks on schools

TURKeY
Two dozen schools were bombed or set on fire and
28 teachers abducted in 2010-2012, mostly in the
south-east, where Kurdish insurgents were active.
Hundreds of university students were arrested in
protests that were suppressed with excessive use
of force.1655

Context
During 2009-2012, the long-running insurgency led by
the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) continued in southeastern Turkey. Armed clashes between the PKK and
the Turkish military escalated in 2011 but in 2013 there
was a ceasefire in the context of a peace process.
The government restricted the right to protest and
constraints on academic freedom continued. There
was a deepening polarization between the religious
conservative government and the secularist
Republican People’s Party.1656 Police violence against
demonstrators continued and protesters, including
students, were beaten at protests. Academics were
arrested in the context of investigations into coup
plots against the government and serious violations of
due process occurred during the controversial trials
that followed. There were also arrests of academics in
association with the Kurdish issue.
On 30 September 2013, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan
announced a package of legal reforms, two of them
relevant to education for Kurdish students and
teachers.1657 Instruction would be allowed in minority
languages, including Kurdish, in private schools but
not in the state sector.1658 An oath of national
allegiance, to which many Kurds objected due to its

Media reports suggest that there were at least two
dozen attacks on schools from 2009 to 2012,1662
mainly in south-eastern Turkey. In one incident,
attackers shouted pro-PKK slogans but in many cases
the perpetrators were not identified. Kurdish militants
were assumed to target schools because they
believed they were being used as tools of assimilation. The majority of attacks were fire-bombings.1663
For instance, it was reported that on 9 October 2012, a
student and two teachers were injured when masked
men threw Molotov cocktails at a high school in
Diyarbakir.1664 During a two-week spate of attacks in
October 2012, suspected PKK activists set at least 20
schools on fire1665 including a kindergarten.1666
A car bomb suspected to have been detonated by the
PKK exploded outside a secondary school in Ankara in
September 2011, killing three people; the schoolyard
was used to treat the injured.1667

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
According to a compilation of media reports, 28
teachers were abducted in 2011-2012,1668 including 12
in one week.1669 Most were kidnapped by PKK
members; many were released shortly afterwards. In
one incident, armed militants broke into a teachers’
staff room and kidnapped six of the 19 teachers
present but released them under pressure from local
people.1670
In one incident in December 2011, a group of PKK
supporters reportedly threw Molotov cocktails and
stones at a housing unit for dozens of teachers, yelling
at them to leave the area and threatening to burn
them.1671
