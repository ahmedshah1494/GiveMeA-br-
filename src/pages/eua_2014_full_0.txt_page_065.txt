Protecting higher education
Most responses to attacks on higher education appear
to focus on either enhancing physical protection or
promoting resilience and adaptability. This study
found no examples of responses in the form of
community protection or turning universities into
‘zones of peace’.211 Alongside the relative dearth of
information about attacks on higher education
compared with attacks on other levels of education,
there is even less about the effectiveness of
responses at the tertiary level.
The physical protection of higher education can take
several forms, including on-campus security guards or
escorts and strengthening gates, fences and windows.
In Colombia, for example, an elaborate protection
scheme for individuals, originally set up for teachers
and teacher trade unionists, was extended to protect
academic and trade union representatives in higher
education. Established by human rights groups,
teacher trade unions, OHCHR and representatives of
the Colombian government, it is providing threatened
or targeted individuals with administrative and
financial support for physical protection measures
and, depending on the type and degree of risk of each
individual case, armed escorts or guards, mobile
phones, bullet-proof vehicles or temporary
relocation.212
A number of measures to promote the resilience of
higher education in response to attacks have also
been taken. Distance learning programmes, such as
those established for Iraq,213 Israel/Palestine214 and
Zimbabwe,215 and scholarship schemes for studying,
teaching or researching abroad have been used to
enable continuity of education where normal teaching
is no longer possible, for instance due to the security
risk of travelling to university. Iraqi academics in exile,
for example, have been able to contribute filmed
lectures to Iraqi universities on specialist subjects
through a Scholar Rescue Fund project.216 In recent
years, scholar protection organizations have also put
an increased focus on funding placements in
countries neighbouring the conflict-affected country to
increase the likelihood of scholars returning to their
homeland when peace is restored.
