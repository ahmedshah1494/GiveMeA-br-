The four academics were seized when their car was ambushed four days earlier as they left Nahrain University’s law school in northern Baghdad, the Ministry of Higher Education said.46On 12 February 2007, up to 16 people were reported killed and 27 wounded after another suicide bomber detonated explosives in a van in a car park between the College of Economic Sciences in Western Baghdad and a food warehouse.47The Iraq Index, compiled by the Brookings Institution in Washington and released on 21 December 2006, estimated that up to 40 per cent of Iraqi professionals had ﬂ ed the country since 2003. The number of teachers leaving nearly doubled last year, according to UNESCO.“The health and educational systems are depleted of good professionals. Nearly one third of those living in Iraq before 2003 have ﬂ ed violence,” Dr Mustafa Jaboury, a research investigator at the ministry, told IRIN News. “Shiite militias and Sunni insurgents are killing intellectuals to ensure Iraq is poorly managed and poorly governed.”
