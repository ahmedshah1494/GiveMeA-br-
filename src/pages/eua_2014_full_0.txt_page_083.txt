For institutional donors
• Increase the flexibility of funding streams
(including the time horizon for implementation)
in order to be able to better tailor programmes
to the context of specific communities and
types of attacks on education, and to facilitate
community engagement and ownership.
• Apply more nuanced conditionality to funding
streams. Conditions that restrict contact
between grant recipients and particular actors
that may perpetrate attacks on education can
inhibit certain protective measures, such as
undertaking or facilitating negotiations with
armed groups or military forces.

For UN agencies and NGOs
• With engagement from communities, conduct a
context and conflict analysis to inform
response design, including:
— assessment of the nature of attacks on
education in relation to the history of the
conflict;
— consideration of whether external assistance can increase the risk that education
may be attacked;
— analysis of community power structures,
knowledge, attitudes and practices that
may exacerbate threats to education or
affect programme implementation; and
— mapping community actions to protect
education.
• Carefully consider the role of the national
government in community protection projects
with attention to conflict dynamics, since, in
some situations, government involvement can
heighten the risk of attack or governments
themselves may be perpetrators. Where appropriate, elicit government participation in
project development, planning and implementation.
