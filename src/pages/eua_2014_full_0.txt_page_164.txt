Six education aid workers were killed in 2009-2012.
Two teachers, one education aid worker and their

Jamrud, Khyber Agency, which provides education and
training for women, was shot dead on 4 July 2012.1246
On 8 December 2011, Zarteef Khan Afridi, the coordinator of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in

only later introduces the more extreme and violent
tenets of militant ideology in a second setting. Some
children were recruited from madrassa schools,1253
others were abducted.1254 Several children who later
escaped have described how they only realized they
