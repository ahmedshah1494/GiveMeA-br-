The agreement tried to rectify this by calling for equitable distribution of buildings, equipment and textbooks.264Similarly the Guatemalan and Chiapas agreements of the mid-1990s state that indigenous teachers should be trained and employed to carry out bilingual and multicultural education to improve social equality and inclusion, thereby addressing grievances around which groups of people in these countries mobilized. The 1996 Guatemalan Agreement on the Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples calls on the government to involve community representatives in the management of education
