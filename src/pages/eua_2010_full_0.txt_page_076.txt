He was 13 or 14 at the time. “They took four students from my school, but after 10-12 km the other three were sent away, and only I was kept”.174He pleaded with them to let him go back to school because he wanted to study. But for the next three years he was forced to remain a dalam (subgroup) member, taking part in several armed battles with government forces and depending on local villages and schools for food.First he was trained to use bows and arrows, and then he was given a rifle and trained to plant bombs. “I used to think of home a lot,” he told Human Rights Watch. “I worried I would never be able to contact my parents. Sometimes I would sit and cry”.175Eventually he deserted, but the Naxalites punished him by killing his two younger brothers, beating up his mother and setting fire to their home.To protect himself, Tarrem surrendered to the auxiliary police. He was still under 18, but worked for them as an informer and joined search operations looking for Naxalites. It made him a wanted man.
