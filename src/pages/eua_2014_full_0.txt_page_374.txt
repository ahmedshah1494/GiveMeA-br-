As stated in the methodology section, the statistical information on enrolment and literacy rates in profiled countries should be treated with caution,
especially in the case of those countries that have experienced considerable
disruption due to armed conflict, insecurity or instability. Though formally
correct, such statistical data may contain outdated information and may not
capture with full accuracy the actual educational situation of a country.
