The bombers used are increasingly children, some as young as 11 years old, recruited and indoctrinated from madrasas and seminaries and trained in Taliban camps in north-west Pakistan, according to officials in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). They are then sold to other Taliban officials.70 Other new reported threats that appear to have been on the rise over this period include the kidnapping of schoolchildren and teachers in Haiti and the Philippines, and gun battles between armed drug gangs and armed police occupying schools in Brazil’s favelas.
