It also requires the UN system to monitor and report on six grave violations against children: the killing or maiming of children, recruitment or use of child soldiers, attacks against schools or hospitals, rape and other forms of sexual violence, abduction of children, and denial of humanitarian access.91 Rima Salah, Deputy Director of UNICEF, hailed this as a “critical measure to hold accountable the parties that continue to harm those children”. The Ofﬁ ce of the Special Representative was given the task of implementing the monitoring and reporting of grave violations in a phased approach beginning with Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and the Sudan. It has also done so in Nepal and Sri Lanka. Its work has added to previous monitoring by the UN system and by NGOs. It has strongly advocated the exclusion of all grave crimes against children from amnesty provisions and legislation arising from peace agreements. It has also sought to end impunity for child-related war crimes by developing a framework for the protection and participation of children in judicial tribunals and truth-seeking processes. This resulted, for instance, in guidelines for the Special Court and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Sierra Leone, and relevant provisions in the International Criminal Court rules of evidence and procedure.Perhaps recognising that by far the most attention had been paid to the child soldier issue, the Secretary-General recommended in October 2006 that the Security Council give equal weight and attention to all six grave violations against children in all conﬂ ict situations of concern.He also encouraged states parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to strengthen national and international measures for the prevention of the recruitment of children for armed forces or armed groups and their use in hostilities, in particular by signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conﬂ ict, and by enacting legislation
