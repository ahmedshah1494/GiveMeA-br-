Local monitoring teams reported that all political activities in schools had ceased as a result of the code.255 In another SZOP initiative by Save the Children US, interviews in four districts showed parents and students felt there was enhanced safety and security at school and violence had ceased.256The success of the SZOP initiatives during the conflict led to a government SZOP campaign after the conflict and in response to emerging unrest in the Terai region.Conducted using national advocacy, public hearings and local negotiations, this achieved the agreement of codes of conduct in nine districts and 403 schools. The results were fewer school days lost to closure during strikes, armed groups stayed out of schools, school governance improved and the misuse of schools for political activities was reduced.257 Since then, efforts have been made to develop a national framework for Schools as Zones of Peace.258The lessons bear some similarities to the lessons of the negotiations in Afghanistan: conditions for success seemed to include ownership of the process by the community, buy-in from the armed opposition and local leadership/sense of ownership of schools. The additional advantage in Nepal was the Maoists’ public commitment to universal education.The CARE study in Afghanistan recommends that where potential attackers are known, community leaders might consider engaging in preventative negotiations with them to try to reach agreement on continuing education locally. But it warned that this option must not be taken lightly and only local leaders would know if it was appropriate, might achieve the opposite effect or would be beyond their reach.259At an international expert seminar, “Protecting Education from Attack”, hosted by UNESCO in Paris in September 2009, it was argued that the efficacy of attempting to challenge armed groups to end attacks on education and comply with international humanitarian law would depend on the motives and structure of such groups. If they are seeking international recognition as a potential government in waiting, they might be more cooperative; but many parties to conflict are made up of semi-autonomous factions with different levels of discipline and different levels of will to comply. Where the objective is to terrorize the civilians or drive an ethnic group out of a region, the task will be considerably more difficult.
