developed an ‘Iraq Scholar Lecture Series’, a distance learning programme that
screens recorded lectures from SRF Iraqi scholar-grantees living abroad to 16

In 2009, UNESCO in partnership with the Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education
and Scientific Research launched the Avicenna Virtual Campus for universities in
Iraq, which built on a previous EC-funded and UNESCO co-ordinated project for
enhancing the adoption and use of Open and Distance Learning (ODL) in nine
Mediterranean non-EU member states. The aim of the project was to expand
access to education and improve the quality of teacher training by promoting
partnerships and exchanges between Iraqi universities and a network of universities abroad.

insofar as it reacts back on a government’s domestic basis of legitimation and
consent and thus ultimately on its ability to stay in power.” This dynamic was

Southern Europe. Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, “International Norm
