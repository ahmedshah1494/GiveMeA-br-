One solution would be for concerned organizations to reach a consensus on which types of data to collect and disseminate, so as to enable both comparative and global analysis. Reaching such a consensus may not be easy, however, given the differing interests of the organizations involved. More detailed research is required into the arrangements, extent and collection methods of different organizations, government ministries and the UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism on Children and Armed Conflict to see how collection of common types of data and information can be encouraged. Ideally, this information should include not just a dataset, for instance along the lines of this studyâ€™s terms of reference (see Section 1), but also information on the impact on education, as set out in Section 7, and measures to provide protection and end impunity, as set out in Sections 8 and 9.A second challenge is ensuring that the information gathered is disseminated widely via the UN system, NGOs and the media. An ambitious step would be to create an Observatory for the Protection of Education from Attack, backed by interested organizations, that would gather support, data and information from all bodies concerned and publish it in one place, providing international access to global reports, country reports and news feeds via a dedicated website.
