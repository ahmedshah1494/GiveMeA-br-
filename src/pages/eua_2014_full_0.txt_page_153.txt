killings of students and teachers by gunmen whose
affiliation and motive were unexplained.
In Ciudad Juárez, in November 2010, there were both
threats against individual teachers and threats posted
on school walls warning that students would be
kidnapped if teachers failed to hand over money to the
perpetrators.1078 One vice-principal of a primary school
said criminals ‘wrote graffiti on the school’s walls
saying: “If you don’t pay up a massacre will
happen”.’1079 In December 2010, the Chihuahua state
senate called on the Governor and President to adopt
a security plan to protect educational institutions in

8,000 pesos bi-weekly, and all of those earning more

teachers’ names, addresses and cell phone numbers,
their voter registration cards and the names and
addresses of their schools, plus the names of anyone
who declined to divulge information.1084 According to
