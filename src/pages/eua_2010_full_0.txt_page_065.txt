He told AP: “These schools are being run under a system introduced by the British and promote obscenity and vulgarity in society”.137The seriousness of the warning was underlined by the fact that the Taliban had attacked around 125 schools in the previous year. Enrolment of girls had already fallen from 120,000 in 2007 to 50,000.138“It is feared that the extremists will carry out their threats,” Ibrash Pasha, provincial coordinator of the Pakistan Coalition for Education, told IRIN. “Convincing parents to send their children, especially the girl child, to school was already an uphill task. Years of hard work put into mobilizing rural communities to educate their girls have come to nought”.139In response to the order, education officials and school administrators announced that 900 schools – 500 public schools and 400 private schools, including 20 colleges – would close, affecting 125,000 students. Nevertheless, on the day after the deadline, a government girls’ school was blown up in a suburb of Mingora, the valley’s commercial capital.140Swat, an idyllic mountainous valley once popular as a holiday destination, had begun to slip out of government control two years earlier. During the fighting since then – as a result of which 1,200 people died and 500,000 fled the area – the Taliban gradually gained control over the valley. As they did so, they entrenched their policy of banning girls from school by burning and bombing schools and spreading propaganda alleging that educating girls was anti-Islamic. Every evening on the local radio, residents were told they were good Muslims if they stopped their daughters
