with costs to the school. See UNESCO, Protecting Education from Attack: A Stateof-the-Art Review (Paris: UNESCO, 2010), 28.

Current debates are characterized by a lack of consensus over what constitutes an ‘attack’ on higher education communities, versus an infringement of
academic freedom [or of the right to education] that falls short of the meaning of
the term ‘attack’. This has methodological repercussions evident in the difficulty
of establishing an agreed-upon set of indicators for monitoring attacks.

For example, according to Jarecki and Kaisth, in three-quarters of cases of
scholars granted assistance by the Scholar Rescue Fund, the sole or a
contributing source of persecution was the state. Henry Jarecki and Daniela
Kaisth, Scholar Rescue in the Modern World (New York: Institute of International
Education, 2009), 8.

sector, see the Global overview in Part I of this study. Also see the ‘Attacks on
higher education’ section in each country profile in Part III of this study.

Brain drain is the process of migration of highly-skilled and educated people
that implies a loss of human capital for the country of origin. Attacks on higher
education may trigger involuntary migration by victims of attacks and those similarly intimidated who seek physical security elsewhere, as well as voluntary
migration by those seeking more favorable, secure and open environments in
which to pursue their academic interests.

York: Institute of International Education, 2009), 17-20. Iraq is a case in point in
illustrating a number of consequences such as self-censorship, fear, retreat and
brain drain following the systematic and widespread attacks on academics and
university students. See Dirk Adriaensen, Lieven De Cauter, Ward Treunen,
Christopher Parker and Sami Zemni, eds., Beyond Educide. Sanctions,

The Draft Lucens Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from
Military Use during Armed Conflict have tried to address the third challenge in
Guideline 5 by stating that: “[T]he fighting forces of parties to armed conflict
should generally not be employed on security tasks related to schools and
universities except when the risk to those institutions is assessed as high; if
alternative means of reducing the likelihood of attack are not feasible; if evacuation from the high risk area is not feasible; and if there are no alternative appropriately trained civilian personnel available to provide security. (a) If such
fighting forces are engaged in security tasks related to schools and universities,
their presence within the grounds or buildings of the school should be avoided if
at all possible, to avoid compromising its civilian status and disrupting the
learning environment.” GCPEA, Draft Lucens Guidelines for Protecting Schools
and Universities from Military Use During Armed Conflict (New York: GCPEA, 8
July 2013).

For example, a 2009 report on human rights violations against Colombian
students, issued jointly by the UK’s National Union of Students, University
College Union and the UK-based NGO Justice for Colombia, concluded that the
Colombian state not only did little to prevent attacks and systematically failed to
capture or punish perpetrators, but also, security forces were found to have been
directly involved in many of the attacks. The report suggests that in such a situation only international pressure and human rights campaigns addressed to the
government can make a real difference. See Colombia: Students in The Firing
Line – A Report on Human Rights Abuses Suffered by Colombian University
Students (National Union of Students, University and College Union and Justice
for Colombia, 2009), 5-7, 9.
