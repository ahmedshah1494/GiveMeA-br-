A serious challenge now in conﬂ ict-affected countries is to move towards a position where schools, colleges and universities can be accepted as safe sanctuaries and shielded from military and political violence. This would involve creating student-friendly, inclusive educational institutions, run transparently and free from sectarianism and political interference, that will give all sides a stake in their protection and advocacy work with armed parties and local communities. Schools, colleges and universities could then become zones of peace promoting tolerance and understanding and in so doing aid efforts to resolve the wider conﬂ ict. If the international community is serious about attempts to achieve Education for All and the Millennium Development Goals on education, it should focus attention urgently on these issues and provide the political will and resources required to tackle this growing problem. A number of recommendations ﬂ ow from the ﬁ ndings and analyses presented in this report, notably the following:The UN should work with Member States to eradicate impunity in the case of   attacks on education staff, students, trade unionists, ofﬁ cials and institutions.Greater resources should be given to the International Criminal Court to bring   more cases to trial to widen its deterrent effect.Governments should use every opportunity to set conditions of adherence to   human rights norms, with particular reference to the rights of children, the right to education and protection of both educational institutions and the process of education when entering trade or aid agreements with parties to a conﬂ ict. Special attention should be paid to the violation of girls’ right to education and women’s right to teach, given the increased targeting of girls’ education for attack in some countries. UN agencies, NGOs and teacher unions should campaign for international   solidarity with targeted groups and institutions to raise pressure for human rights instruments to be applied more widely to attacks on education and for impunity to be eradicated. Further debate is also required on how to make the case for embedding protection of education institutions as zones of peace or safe sanctuaries in human rights instruments.The UN Security Council should recognize the role that education can play in   both contributing to tension and in promoting peace, and should offer support for strategies to remove education as a factor in conﬂ icts.
