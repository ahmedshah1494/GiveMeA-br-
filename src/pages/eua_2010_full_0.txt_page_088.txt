Such attacks represent serious breaches of human rights and academic freedom – including “the right to contribute to social change through freely expressing their opinion on state policies and policies affecting higher education” as set out in the 1997 Recommendation Concerning the Status of Higher Education Personnel – and pose a threat to economic, social and political development.As Jarecki and Kaisth have argued:“When a scholar is killed or silenced, a lifetime of teaching and learning that could provide thousands of hours of education for hundreds of students, with all the benefits that provides for the community at large, is lost. Other scholars silence themselves out of fear; students are reluctant to pursue their education, and the entire intellectual community upon which any country must base its growth and development suffers. “The death, and even the silencing of a scholar, leads to the death of ideas – ideas that could have led to new cures for disease, economic growth in developing economies, improved methods of food production, or better protection of the most vulnerable sectors of society”.207Their research for the Institute of International Education suggests it may be precisely those countries that most need such ideas as well as the energy and innovation generated by an open academic community in which academics are most likely to come under attack.
