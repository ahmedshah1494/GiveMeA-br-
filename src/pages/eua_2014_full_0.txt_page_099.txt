practices that would have the same result while
preserving their legal rights.
There has been evidence recently of the advantages of
taking a softer and more pragmatic approach that
might have a greater chance of succeeding than trying
to change the law. An obvious example is the
production of both the Montreux Document regulating
the activities of Private Military and Security
Companies387 and the subsequent Code of Conduct for
Private Security Service Providers.388 Another is the
establishment of Guiding Principles on Internal
Displacement.389 Such documents are not
treaties; they are not, therefore, a source of
international law and are consequently not legally
binding on states – although they do have the
potential to change or improve behaviour.390 Treaty
negotiations would be difficult to initiate; by
comparison, developing and seeking the adoption of
voluntary guidelines would be more achievable, could
change the law over time and ultimately might be
more effective.

Developing international guidelines
Following wide consultations with states representatives and other experts, GCPEA decided to develop
guidelines rather than attempt to initiate international
negotiations for a convention that would change the
applicable law. A workshop attended by a number of
experts was convened at the Geneva Academy of
International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights in
early 2012. The workshop recommended the development of a set of guidelines for protecting schools
and universities from military use during armed
conflict. The draft that eventually emerged was
shaped around several considerations, namely:
• While any guidelines should aim to effect a
change of behaviour, they should respect international law as it stands and not propose
changes to it. They should not be legally
binding in themselves or affect existing obligations under international law.
• The guidelines should reflect what is practically
achievable and acknowledge that parties to
armed conflict are invariably faced with difficult
dilemmas requiring pragmatic solutions.
