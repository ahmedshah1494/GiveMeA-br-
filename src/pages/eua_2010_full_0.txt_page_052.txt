Violence affects the whole population without discrimination, including unionized and non-unionized teachers”.74However, two-thirds of teachers murdered are trade union members, according to National Police figures, and 60 per cent of murders of trade unionists globally occur in Colombia, suggesting that trade unionist activity may be a motive in their killings. To put education attacks in context, in the ten years to the end of 2008, 2,694 trade unionists were murdered in Colombia.75 Although the perpetrators are unknown in 75 per cent of violations of the human rights of trade unionists in Colombia, they are known to be paramilitaries in 15 per cent of violations, state organizations in 6 per cent and guerrillas in 3 per cent, according to the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.76 According to Escuela Nacional Sindical (which tracks only the violations against unionized education workers), among murders of trade unionists, the perpetrator was unknown in 74 per cent of cases in 2006 and in 77 per cent of cases in 2007. The percentage of education trade unionists killed by state organizations rose from 2.8 in 2006 to 12.8 in 2007, representing the majority of cases in which the perpetrator was identified. The percentage killed by paramilitaries fell from 12.5 per cent in 2006 to 5.1 per cent in 2007. In 2007, there were 11 acts of victimization of Colombian trade unionists by guerrilla groups; of these, five incidents involved threats and six were cases of forced displacement. The victims were education union members in the departments of Arauca, Narino, Atlantico, Huila and Caqueta; all but one of them were women.
