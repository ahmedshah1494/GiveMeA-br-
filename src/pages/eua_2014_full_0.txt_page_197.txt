Attacks on education in 2013
According to a UN respondent, attacks on schools fell
significantly in 2013 compared to 2012.1750 The UN
verified that on 23 February, Houthi fighters stormed
into the Imam Hadi primary school in Sharmat,
Sa’ada, demanding to keep one prisoner inside the
school temporarily and, when the request was
refused, opened fire, wounding a teacher;1751 and that
in July, Houthi rebels armed with machine guns
occupied a school in Dammaj district.1752 On 27
September 2013, Jabir Ali Hamdan, a teacher at the
Sa’ada School in Maeen area in Razih, was reportedly
imprisoned and threatened with death after he had
broken a stick on which the Houthi slogan of Al-Sarkha
(‘God is Great/Death to America/Death to Israel/Curse
the Jews/Victory to Islam’1753) was written. He was later
released.1754
There were continuing local media reports of incidents
of Houthi rebels shooting school staff, threatening
teachers and taking over schools, mostly in Sa’ada
governorate,1755 and of attacks on students and
teachers by other armed groups or armed gangs in
other Yemeni governorates, but these have not been
confirmed by UN or human rights sources. They
included the shooting of teachers and students as

well as bombings and shootings at examination
centres. The incidents were reported in Sana’a1756 and
the Ta’izz,1757 Hodeida and Hajja governorates,1758 as
well as in Lani province.1759

ZIMBABWe
Hundreds of university students were unlawfully
arrested or unlawfully detained during 2009-2012, and
police and state security forces violently repressed
several protests at universities. School teachers faced
intimidation and death threats, and some schools were
used as militia bases.1760

Context
Zimbabwe experienced ongoing political violence
after the emergence in 1999 of the political party the
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to challenge
Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union –
Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) for power.1761 This violence
was particularly intense during election periods.1762
According to a study by the Progressive Teachers
Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ), one in two teachers
surveyed had directly experienced political violence
between 2000 and 2012.1763 Most reported that this
violence took place during the school day.1764 The
Student Solidarity Trust (SST) reported 211 cases of
abduction and torture of university students from
2006 to 2010.1765
In the build-up to the 2008 presidential elections and
during their aftermath, attacks on teachers and
teacher trade unionists, including killings, arrests,
incarcerations, destruction of homes, torture and
threats of violence, were reported.1766 Many schools
became sites for enforced political rallies in which
teachers and head teachers were repeatedly and
publicly threatened with death.1767
The political situation changed in 2008, when Morgan
Tsvangirai, of the MDC, and President Mugabe came to
a power-sharing agreement that lasted until elections
in July 2013, which Mugabe won by a landslide.1768
During 2009-2012, there were incidents of political
pressure on students and teachers and political use of
schools, mostly implicating Zanu-PF supporters, but in
one reported incident the MDC was involved.1769

For example, pupils and teachers were ordered to
attend a Zanu-PF rally held at Mount Carmel School in
May 2011, forcing several schools in Manicaland
province to shut on a weekday.1770 In another incident,
the MDC organized a rally at Pagwashi Primary School
in the Cashel Valley of Chimanimani East that was
allegedly disrupted by Zanu-PF supporters, creating a
situation that police warned was volatile.1771
Schools were reportedly used in the Zanu-PF
campaign against international sanctions, despite a
government directive prohibiting it.1772 On one
occasion, a senior education official in Chikomba
district, Mashonaland East province, ordered that all
schools be employed for signing an anti-sanctions
petition and that head teachers act as unpaid polling
officers to oversee the exercise.1773
There are no recent figures for primary or secondary
enrolment. In 2011, gross tertiary enrolment was 6 per
cent and the adult literacy rate was 84 per cent.1774

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
A compilation of media and human rights reports
suggests numerous teachers faced harassment,
expulsion, threats of political violence and death
because Zanu-PF supporters accused them of
supporting the MDC.
In 2009, local militia and tribal leaders allegedly
forced schools to provide them with offices and
appointed ‘youth coordinators’ and school prefects
without permission from education authorities. In
these positions, they allegedly intimidated teachers in
school, leading them to fear for their security, and kept
the youth militia informed of activities within the
schools.1775
In November 2010, PTUZ said Zanu-PF supporters led
by war veterans were trying to ‘cleanse’ Mashonaland
province of teachers after President Mugabe
announced that elections might be held the following
year. PTUZ cited the case of six teachers who were
forcibly transferred to other schools in Zanu-PF strongholds and feared for their lives. There was a history of
war veterans and Zanu-PF supporters accusing
teachers of supporting the MDC and targeting them
with political violence.1776
