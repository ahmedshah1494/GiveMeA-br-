In other words, there is a danger that the quest to improve protection for education targets could actually leave them with less protection in law.A dissenting view on this point, offered by Saad Jabber, is that the passing of Security Council Resolution 1738 (2006), which protects journalists, demonstrates that it is not necessarily impractical to push for a resolution for a specific group such as academics. Such a resolution would complement the existing protection of children and schools and staff who work in them by SC Resolution 1612.306 On the other hand, there are also concerns that any measure that privileges protection of one group of people, or one set of buildings over another, risks legitimating attacks on other targets that are not afforded special protection.One significant gap in IHL, particularly from the perspective of attacks on higher education or education trade unionists in non-conflict situations, is coverage below the threshold of what constitutes an armed conflict. Such violations are normally regulated by national criminal law. However, systematic attacks in peacetime are covered by Article 7 of the Rome Statute, as will be discussed later, although this would not apply to one-off attacks. This study shares the conclusion that “while action should be taken to correct any weak places in the law, most of the work to strengthen protection will have to go to solving other dimensions of the problem”.307 A range of aspects need tackling in order to realize the potential of international law and national laws to help deter attacks. These include:Referring more cases concerning perpetrators and commanders (who knew or ought to have known a war crime was taking place or failed to stop it taking place) to national prosecutors and, where appropriate, the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court;Researching and monitoring the effectiveness of accountability mechanisms in reducing impunity for education attacks;
