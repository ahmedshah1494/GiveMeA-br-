It also comprises the imposition of political programmes in schools and education institutions under threat of force by armed groups.The common thread is that these are incidents involving the deliberate use of force in ways that disrupt and deter the provision of education. Mostly, such attacks occur in conflict-affected countries. But many, particularly in higher education, occur in non-conflict countries, particularly those governed by repressive regimes.The terms of the study do not include collateral damage, for example, where teachers are killed or schools damaged accidentally by general military violence rather than by attacks deliberately targeted against them. The study does not include non-politically motivated gun, knife or arson attacks by students or individual adults, such as the killing of 15 people by 17-year-old former student Tim Kretschmer at Albertville High School, Winnenden, Germany, on 11 March 2009.3 Nor does it include general violence or unruly behaviour between students or between students and teachers.There are grey areas that test the definition of attacks on education. For instance, there may be little information available as to whether suicide bombs exploded outside a university gate, as occurred with devastating consequences at Mustansiriya University, Baghdad, on 16 January 2007, killing 70 students and injuring 170 others,

Other similar incidents in the reporting period include: the killing of ten people by the 22-year-old student Matti Juhani Saari at Finland’s Seinajoki University of Applied Sciences on September 23, 2008; the killing of seven students and the principal by 18-year-old Pekka-Rid Auvinen at Jokela High School, Tuusula, Finland, on November 7, 2007; and the killing of 32 people by student gunman Seung-Hui Cho in the United States’ worst campus shooting, at Virginia Tech, Balacksburg, Virginia, on April 16, 2007.
