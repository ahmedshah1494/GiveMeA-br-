
sometimes claiming responsibility for attacks and
sometimes denying activities attributed to them by
others, making the overall conflict – and efforts to
determine the source of attacks – complex. The UN
Mission also verified four attacks by armed groups
that were not anti-government in 2012 and at least
nine by Afghan Local Police,410 as well as one incident
in which American forces ‘bombarded’ a school in
Nangarhar province, injuring 12 children and a school
employee and damaging the school building.411 The
UN Secretary-General’s Report on Children and Armed
Conflict said that among documented – as opposed to
verified412 – incidents, attacks by anti-government
elements outnumbered those by pro-government
forces by two to one and approximately one in four
attacks were by unidentified perpetrators.413 An earlier
study reported that criminal gangs have also
threatened or attacked schools in Afghanistan.414
Motives for attacks by armed non-state groups
included opposition to the perceived ‘western’ or ‘unIslamic’ curriculum, external affiliations of the school
or the perceived role of Western forces in rebuilding
some schools, the education of girls generally, or any
operation of the central government.415 Other attacks
were motivated by the wider political objectives of the
insurgency in particular areas or the use of schools by
opposing forces (see the Military use of schools
section of this profile).416
In 2012, the Taliban made public statements saying it
did not oppose education but only curricula that tried
to supplant Islamic and national values with western
culture. It also denied responsibility for attacks on
schools. Nevertheless, the UN reported that attacks
and threats of attack continued in areas controlled by
anti-government groups, including the Taliban.417 In
some places, the Taliban allowed schools to reopen,
sometimes due to public opposition to their
continuing closure. In these areas, there is evidence
that Taliban officials sought to control the curriculum
and the appointment of teachers, and place additional
restrictions on girls.418 They also appointed
‘controllers’ or shadow directors who distributed
Taliban directives on schools and pressed local
officials to change the curriculum in line with Taliban
thinking. In some cases, they checked if teachers and
students were turning up to school. 419

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
In addition to schools being damaged, destroyed or
shut down, students, teachers and other education
personnel were killed, injured, abducted and driven
away from their schools. School students, teachers
and other education personnel were killed or injured
by the use of IEDs and suicide bombing attacks.420
Grenades were lobbed into schoolyards.421 Bombs
were hidden in pushcarts and rickshaws, or carried on
motorbikes.422 For instance, on 20 October 2010, at
least eight children were killed when a powerful
roadside bomb blasted a school bus carrying girls in
the Khash Rod district of Nimrod province.423 On 3 July
2011, a suspected militant on a motorbike threw a
grenade at the main gate of a school in Faryab
province, wounding 17 children, two critically.424 On 3
May 2012, three students and two teachers were
injured when an attacker threw a grenade into the
playground of Mir Ghulam Mohmmad Ghubar High
School in Kabul.425
According to UN figures, at least 24 teachers and other
education personnel and 23 students were killed and
342 students and 41 teachers and education
personnel were injured in attacks on education in
2009.426 In 2010, at least 21 students, teachers or
education officials were killed.427 In 2011, 25
education staff members were killed and seven
abducted; in one incident, six teachers were killed and
one abducted, allegedly by anti-government
elements.428 UNAMA recorded six instances of
targeted killings of teachers, school guards and
department of education officials by anti-government
elements during the first six months of 2012 — an
increase compared with the first six months of 2011.429
Separately reported, one of the most serious incidents
in 2012 involved an ambush in May of a convoy of
education officials travelling to visit schools in Paktika
province. According to the police and a provincial
government spokesperson, the convoy was hit by a
remotely detonated roadside bomb and then came
under gunfire. Five officials were killed and three
others wounded.430
Threats to girl students and their teachers
Attackers frequently targeted girls’ education. ‘Night

letters’ – threatening letters placed at night outside
schools, en route to the school or outside teachers’
homes – were distributed in the southern, southeastern, central and northern regions, warning entire
communities not to send their daughters to school
and calling on teachers and government employees to
close schools, especially girls’ schools. Some letters
warned that failure to comply with the demand would
lead to retribution, such as acid or gas attacks.431 In
another example, in 2009, a teacher at a girls’ school
received a letter with Taliban insignia that forced her to
quit her post: ‘We warn you to leave your job as a
teacher as soon as possible otherwise we will cut the
heads off your children and we shall set fire to your
daughter…This is your first and last warning.’432 In
some cases, the threats were carried out. In May 2011,
for instance, the head teacher of Porak girls’ school,
Logar province, was shot and killed near his home
after receiving repeated death threats telling him not
to teach girls.433
Alleged poison attacks
There were numerous allegations of mass school
poisonings, either through intentional contamination
of drinking water or by the release of gas into the air,
including 17 such alleged incidents in the first half of
2012.434 Although no scientific evidence has been
found to support these attacks, they have escalated
fear and disrupted children’s access to education. For
example, on 12 May 2009, at Qazaaq school, north of
Kabul, five girls reportedly went into comas and
almost 100 others were hospitalised, allegedly due to
the release of toxic gas.435 Similar attacks were
reported at other girls’ schools.436 An alleged poison
attack in Kunduz city in 2010 caused 1,500 girls to
miss classes at Khadeja-tul Kubra high school.437 By
mid-2012, hundreds of students and education staff
affected by such incidents had been treated by
medical officials for symptoms such as nausea and
unconsciousness.
In June 2012, Afghanistan’s National Directorate of
Security announced that it had arrested 15 people,
including two schoolgirls, who confessed to
involvement in poison attacks in Takhar province.438
However, UNAMA expressed concern that the people
