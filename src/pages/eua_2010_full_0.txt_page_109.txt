Some of these efforts have resulted in improved protection for civilians, demonstrating that engagement can be an effective strategy. However non-state actors may be unwilling to cooperate with state authorities in certain situations precisely because of tension over education, particularly when the “hearts and minds” and/or cultural identity of children are at issue.265The question remains whether peace agreements have been successfully implemented in countries where education has been a target of attack, and what, if any, effect they have had in improving prevention of and protection from attacks, in mitigating the educational impact of attacks in the long-term and in removing education as source of tension. Further research is needed in this area before any conclusions can be drawn.
