
Attacks on schools
The number of attacks by Maoists on schools declined
steeply over the 2009-2012 period from a peak in
2009.736 Human Rights Watch documented attacks by
Maoists on at least 36 schools in Jharkhand and 23
schools in Bihar during 2009.737 The number of attacks
appeared to increase in the run-up to Lok Sabha
(House of Representatives) elections from April to May
2009.738 The Home Ministry, in a 2011 report, cited a
total of 71 school attacks in 2009, 39 in 2010 and 27 in
2011 across Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh,
Bihar, Maharashtra and Jharkhand.739 It reported only
three incidents in 2012740 but the perceived risk of
attack remained – for example, a school in Balangir,
Orissa, was closed for 12 days in September 2012 after
a Maoist poster was found pasted on the school,
triggering fear among parents and teachers that
Maoists would attack.741
Maoists frequently cited use of school buildings by
security forces as the reason for attacking schools,
claiming them to be legitimate military targets.
However, Human Rights Watch research found that
Maoists had damaged or destroyed numerous schools
that were not actually occupied by security forces at
the time of attack.742 Some Maoists justified attacking
newly built schools because they believed they would
be used to house police carrying out operations
against them. In many reported cases, Maoists also
claimed to have attacked a school because it was
previously rather than currently used by police.743
Maoists tended to attack at night, often using cans
packed with explosives – though, in at least one case,
insurgents set fire to a school’s two generators.744
Destruction from these explosions ranged from minor
structural damage to the collapse of entire structures.745
For example, in one incident on 9 April 2009, Maoists
blew up Belhara High School in Jharkhand. They
triggered two dynamite blasts in the evening, leaving
holes in the walls of two classrooms, a hole in the first
floor and cracks around the building, making it unsafe.
It was the tenth government building destroyed in a
week during the run-up to elections on 16 April.746
Following the attack, one or two dozen fewer students
attended the school and some classes had to be taken

on the school verandas because of the damage.747 In
another incident, on 14 April 2009, a witness told
Human Rights Watch that Maoists planted mines in
Gosain-Pesra Middle School, Bihar, and blew them up
remotely, causing half of the two-storey structure to
collapse to the ground.748
Seven incidents targeting Christian schools were also
reported, primarily by Christian sources, five of them
allegedly perpetrated by Hindu militants.749 For
example, on 26 January 2009, a group of Hindutva
activists attacked St Mary’s School at Kadiri in Andhra
Pradesh, destroying the furniture and injuring several
of the nuns, purportedly because the school had not
hoisted the national flag on Republic Day.750 Others
were attacked, apparently by Muslim protesters. On 16
September 2010, it was reported that one Christian
school in Jammu and Kashmir, the Tangmarg branch of
Tyndale Biscoe school, was razed to the ground,751 and
another, the Roman Catholic Good Shepherd High
School at Pulwama, was burned down during protests
over alleged desecrations of the Koran in the United
States.752

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
A tally of incidents reported by media and human
rights groups indicates that at least 13 teachers,753 one
catering staff member754 and four students755 were
killed from 2009 to 2012. At least 73 teachers756 and 11
students757 were injured. Seven teachers were
abducted, five of whom were subsequently found
dead,758 and at least two students were kidnapped.759
Maoists were suspected in a number of attacks on
teachers and the killing of at least four students.
Motives were not always clear but often the Maoists
alleged that their victims were police informers. In
several cases, it appeared that the teachers were
targeted after refusing to cooperate in some way: for
example, by declining to send their students for
Maoist training, refusing to pay levies to the People’s
Committee against Police Atrocities (PCPA) or
removing black flags hoisted outside their schools by
Maoists on Republic Day.760 In one illustrative
incident, the head teacher of Indiraboni primary
school in West Bengal was reportedly gunned down by
three Maoists on motorcycles amid claims that he had

prevented students from taking part in rallies
organized by Maoists.761 A number of teachers also
seemed to have been targeted because of their affiliations with the Communist Party of India–Marxist
(CPI-M). Many teachers refused to work in areas
affected by the Maoist conflict out of fear for their
safety.762
In at least two incidents, suspected Maoists were
reported to have killed individuals at schools in front
of students and teachers. On 14 September 2009, a
group of Maoists shot dead a teacher and CPI-M
member in Jamda High School in West Bengal after
entering the classroom where he was teaching.763 On
20 March 2009, a Class 9 student, and son of a police
officer who had been killed the previous year, was
fatally shot and then stabbed by Maoist guerrillas in
front of students at his school in Koyalibeda, in
Chhattisgarh.764
One media outlet said in August 2012 that children in
Maoist-affected areas of Jharkhand’s East Singhbhum
district were carrying bows and arrows to school,
fearing attacks from the insurgents. Local people had
been training children to defend themselves because
the children had to travel two kilometres to school
through thick forests.765
Several abductions and killings of teachers by
militants from separatist groups were reported in
Assam, in most cases after teachers refused to give in
to demands for money.766
In at least six incidents767 reported by Christian
sources, staff or students at Christian schools were
said to have been injured or threatened. For example,
on 29 May 2009, Hindu militants allegedly attacked a
Christian missionary school in Andhra Pradesh,
beating several teachers, telling them not to work in
the village and threatening to kill them.768
In Jammu and Kashmir, when schools reopened in the
Kashmir Valley in late September 2010 after a threemonth closure following violence and curfews,
separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani reportedly
called on parents not to send their children to school
and appealed to teachers to stay at home as part of a
political protest against alleged civilian deaths during
security operations. The chief minister of the state,
Omar Abdullah, appealed to separatists not to target
