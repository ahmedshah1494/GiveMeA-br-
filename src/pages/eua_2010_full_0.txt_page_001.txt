It did so in response to the shooting of Safia Ama Jan, a champion of women’s rights in Afghanistan, outside her home in Kandahar in the south of the country. Ama Jan had risked her life under Taliban rule to teach girls in defiance of bans on girls receiving education and women working; since 2001, as Director of Women’s Affairs in her province, she had worked tirelessly to get girls back into school.Following her assassination, then UNESCO Director-General Koïchiro Matsuura urged the national and international community to stand united against the forces that would seek to destroy the efforts made by people like her. “We must do our utmost to defend and ensure the security of those who are working in this vital area,” he said.UNESCO was concerned with attacks on education for three reasons: the threat to the right to life, the threat to the right to education which also enables the fulfilment of other basic rights and fundamental freedoms, and the threat to the achievement of the Education for All goals.In an effort to raise awareness about attacks on education and to better understand the nature and scale of the problem, Mark Richmond, Director of the Division for the Coordination of UN Priorities in Education in UNESCO’s Education Sector, commissioned the global study. It covered the ten years to 2007, and found that the reported number of targeted attacks on students, educational staff and institutions seemed to have risen dramatically in the three years from 2004 to 2006.Since then there have been thousands more reported cases of students, teachers, academics and other education staff being kidnapped, imprisoned, beaten, tortured, burned alive, shot, or blown up by rebels, armies and repressive regimes; or recruited or sexually violated by armed groups or armed forces at school or on their journey to or from school.The effects on education of such incidents will be felt long after the funerals have taken place, through loss of teachers and intellectuals, flight of students and staff, fear of turning up to class, grief and psychological trauma among students and personnel, damage to buildings, materials and resources, and degradation of the education system through staffing recruitment difficulties and halted investment.This report is a follow-up to Education under Attack (2007). Its remit is to track the extent, nature and impact of incidents from January 2007 to July 2009, as well as
