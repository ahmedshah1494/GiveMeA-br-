In the same country, schools have been looted by police and ransacked by rebels, and neighbouring schools have been occupied by the national army and the rebel group CNDP.In both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and more recently in Nepal, political movements linked to armed groups have tried to implement political programmes in schools that could be a prelude to indoctrination and recruitment of child combatants.In Africa, in particular, the abduction and sexual abuse of schoolgirls and women teachers are reported to occur on the journey to or from school but research is needed into whether they also occur in raids on schools, particularly for child soldier recruitment. Child recruitment and sexual violence are often linked: in some cases, girls, and sometimes boys, are forced to become sex slaves for the armed groups who abduct them.At the higher education level, sexual violence against detained students and academics of both sexes has been alleged in Iran.Some countries experience a wide variety of attacks on education. For instance, in Colombia between 2007 and 2009, the Escuela Nacional Sindical figures for violations against education union members included 455 death threats, 245 forced displacements, 52 murders, five kidnappings, five arbitrary detentions, four attacks without causing injury, three forced disappearances (presumed dead), two illegal raids, and one case of torture.69Two disturbing new tactics are the apparently increasing number of direct attacks on schoolchildren, particularly in Afghanistan and Thailand, and the mass abduction and indoctrination of children in Pakistan to become suicide bombers.
