part of an attempt to discourage them from trying to
register an independent National Teachers’
Association (NTA). Previously, the government had
seized the assets of the former Ethiopian Teachers’
Association and given the name to a governmentappointed entity. As of the end of 2012, NTA members
had not received notification of any decision by the
Charities and Societies Agency on whether they would
be permitted to register the NTA.712
There were reports of teachers who were fired,
arrested or otherwise harassed by security officials
because they refused to become EPRDF members,
were outspoken about political activities, or refused to
monitor the activities of their students for security
officials.713
In 2011, during the implementation of the Gambella
Region’s ‘villagization’ programme, students were
forced to go to neighbouring villages and build tukuls
(huts) for the new villagers. Students who refused
were not permitted to sit their year-end examinations.
Teachers who refused to organize students for this
activity were suspended or arrested.714

Investigation Sector, a detention centre also known as
Maekelawi, between 2011 and 2013.720
Throughout Ethiopia, students were detained by
security officials for organizing student associations,
being politically outspoken or organizing cultural
movements. The monitoring of students was one of
the key methods through which rural Ethiopians,
particularly Oromos, were targeted because of
involvement in lawful political movements. There were
anecdotal reports of Oromo students being released
from detention and not being allowed to complete
their schooling.721
In January 2010, Oromia police shot two unarmed
students, one fatally, during a disturbance at Ardayta
College; one policeman was found guilty of murder
and imprisoned.722
In June 2012, according to the HRLHA, security forces
stormed dormitories and arrested engineering
students at Haromaya University in Oromia to break up
a demonstration; they were held outside without food
for two days.723

Attacks on education in 2013

During the Ethiopian military’s response to an attack
by unknown gunmen on a commercial farm in the
Gambella region in April 2012, soldiers used a school
in Chobo-Mender as a prison.715

Arrests of university students continued in 2013, with
at least three incidents reported.724 Security agents
reportedly arrested and detained some 100 Addis
Ababa University students, a majority of whom were
Oromo, after a violent clash erupted between two
groups of students on the Arat Kilo University Campus
(College of Natural Science) on 2 January.725 It was
reported that a number of these students were injured
and several had to be hospitalized.726 The clash was
said to have been triggered when Tigrean students put
up posters with insulting messages about Oromo
students.727 Police reportedly surrounded the campus
and detained at least 100 more students of Arba
Minch University in May who were said to have been
responsible for organizing a protest over educationrelated grievances.728 One Addis Ababa University
student was also arrested on campus in March after
expressing concern via Facebook about alleged
corruption among Arba Minch University officials and
city administrators; he was subsequently charged with
criminal defamation.729

Attacks on higher education
The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization,
in its April 2009 Universal Periodic Review submission
on Ethiopia, alleged that more than 80 Oromo
students from Bahir Dar University were arrested and
others were beaten in March 2009 during peaceful
protests.716 The Human Rights League of the Horn of
Africa (HRLHA)717 reported that a law student at Addis
Ababa University, who had been active in the Union of
Oromo Students, was arrested without a court warrant
in front of the main campus by security agents in July
2009.718 Amnesty International reported arrests of
students accused of supporting the OLF at the universities of Jimma, Haromaya and Nekemte in April
2011.719 Human Rights Watch documented arbitrary
arrests, torture and ill-treatment of a number of Oromo
students at Addis Ababa’s Federal Police Crime
