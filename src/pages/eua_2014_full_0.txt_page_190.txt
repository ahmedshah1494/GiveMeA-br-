schools, some of which turned violent or resulted in
arbitrary mass arrests.1633 On 4 September 2012, the
government’s Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO)
seized the assets of an Islamic religious school in
Narathiwat province for allegedly using the school as a
centre for making bombs.1634

Child recruitment from schools
The International Crisis Group reported in 2009 that
