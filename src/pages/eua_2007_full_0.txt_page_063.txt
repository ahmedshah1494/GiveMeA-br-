It can do this in three main ways, by:widening the implementation and application of human rights instruments,  using aid and trade deals as leverage, and  supporting and raising the proﬁ le of international solidarity campaigns that   highlight the issues. If every time there is an attack there is no investigation, nobody is arrested and no one is charged, people will give up hope that the violence will ever end, and that is already the situation in Iraq, suggests Djelid.One important strategy for ending impunity is to press parties to ratify and implement or adhere to relevant international standards on human rights, children’s rights, the right to education, the International Labour Organization (ILO) /UNESCO recommendations on the status of teachers and of higher education teaching personnel and the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining. Useful tactics include encouraging states to make adherence to norms and standards a precondition for trade or aid deals with parties who violate education workers’ and students’ rights, and supporting international solidarity campaigns that highlight abuses of rights.It may be easier to apply pressure on states during conﬂ icts than on rebel forces, which may operate in secret, be elusive, have no clear leadership and may not have clear objectives to provide a basis of negotiation. But when rebel movements come to the negotiating table and seek international aid, for instance to regroup as a democratic political party, there is an opportunity to set conditions.The most commonly used human rights instruments and standards include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Optional Protocol to that Convention on children in armed conﬂ ict, and the ILO core Conventions 87 and 98 on the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. The 1966 and 1997 Recommendations concerning the Status of Teachers and concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel, adopted by UNESCO
