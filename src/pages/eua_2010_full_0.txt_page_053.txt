Most of the attacks by state organizations fall into the category of death threats, for which the ratio of identifiable state organization threats to guerrilla threats was 24:5 in 2008, 101:10 in 2008 and 18:2 in 2009 as of the end of July.77ENS data suggests that unionized education workers are more likely to be issued with death threats if they are involved in union activities such as making public statements, campaigning or collective negotiations.78 In other words, they are more likely to be targeted if they are active or play a leading role.New research in this reporting period has deepened understanding of the motives behind attacks on schools, teachers and teacher escorts in southern Thailand as well.Previously, Thai authorities suggested that the conflict in the south was the work of disparate separatists groups. But Thai police now say that the rebellion is led by a well-structured organization operating across four provinces: Songkhla, Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat.

Islamic courts were abolished and Malay students were forced to pay their respects to images of Buddha placed in public schools.83 Those who resisted were arrested, and some of them tortured.
