As mentioned earlier, while international humanitarian and criminal law outlaws the targeting of education systems, international human rights law, concerning the right to life and the right to education, contains a “duty to protect” the public from attacks by private actors, even in times of armed conflict or insecurity.The effectiveness of these laws should not be judged merely by the number of prosecutions brought for failing to comply with them, but also by the extent to which positive measures are taken to uphold the rights they are designed to protect.There is an important job to be done in offering states assistance to enforce these laws in the name of enhancing human rights. A dynamic and constructive way of doing this would be to encourage collaboration on the development of internationally endorsed guidelines for protecting education systems during war and insecurity.314Such a process would be inclusive, involving states, military officials, security and legal experts, humanitarian bodies, education organizations and others. The aim would be to provide a comprehensive list of concrete actions that could be taken to improve protection, such as enacting legislation to make the relevant human rights violations a crime under national law, and providing training for military lawyers, officers and troops specifically to understand how to avoid an attack on education. The guidelines would underpin advocacy for particular prevention measures to be taken. Significantly, they would also provide judges with guidance that would help them determine their decisions, for instance on whether reasonable steps were taken to establish if a building was a protected school building before it was attacked, or whether reasonable action was taken to prevent a school being attacked by private actors. The ultimate aim should be to seek the adoption of such guidelines by the UN General Assembly as a clear statement of what states individually and collectively agree they should undertake.
