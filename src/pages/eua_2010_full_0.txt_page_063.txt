The number of incidents rose from 63 in 2003 and 2004 to 75 in 2005, 106 in 2006, 119 in 2007 and 155 in 2008. In the past three years, there has been a sharp increase in the percentage of international staff killed, while the percentage of national staff killed has continued to increase.Three out of four attacks occurred in just seven countries (Sudan, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Chad, Iraq and Pakistan). It is not known how many were attacks on education aid workers, although it is known that such attacks were not confined to these states. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in December 2007, the convoy of an international NGO, AVSI, delivering educational materials was ambushed; in October 2008, the office of the IRC, an active education partner, was attacked; and in December 2008, an education aid worker in Rutsuru was shot dead.129 Mario Novelli, Senior Lecturer in International Development Studies at the University of Amsterdam, suggests that the apparent increase in reported killings of education aid workers and aid workers in general should be viewed in the context of a trend in aid giving towards addressing the effects of conflict and the weaknesses of fragile states. He points to a sharp rise in the percentage of OECD/Development Assistance Committee aid going to conflict-affected or fragile states, from 9.3 per cent in 2000 to 38.4 per cent in 2007, and an increasing acceptance of the importance of education in conflict situations, partly fuelled by the worldwide drive to achieve Education for All.130 Aid Worker Security Database figures suggest that, among the 45 per cent of incidents where the motive was known, the share of incidents known to have been politically motivated has risen from 29 per cent in 2003 to 39 per cent in 2008. In Afghanistan in particular, there has been a dramatic increase in the percentage of attacks attributed to armed opposition groups, rising from 39 per cent in 2007 to 65 per cent in 2008. Stoddard, Harmer and DiDomenico posit that “…aid organizations are being attacked not just because they are perceived to be cooperating with Western political actors, but because they are perceived as wholly a part of the Western agenda”. They report that a few years ago, locals would have made distinctions between those agencies
