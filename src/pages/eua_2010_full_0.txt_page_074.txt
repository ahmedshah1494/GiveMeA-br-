Most teachers do not get paid so I looked for other jobs. I used to sell food, sugar, for the mining on the weekends. On a Sunday night I was working at the mine and there was an attack. “They took about ten women and walked us around the forest and turned us around and around. They wanted to make us think we were far away. They walked us for a long time. Until 1.00 a.m. We were hungry. They said they wanted to share dinner. I was dinner. “Five men were kicking and raping me. They spread me and were raping me. They smashed my eyes and now I have trouble reading. They broke my teeth. They cut my wedding ring off. They said you are the wife of nobody now. You belong to all of us”.Honorata, a school director in North Kivu when she was captured, was kept as a sexual slave for the whole of 2002. Hers is a story of extraordinary brutality, but she is just one of tens of thousands of victims of sexual violence in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which include teachers and girls seized on their way to school. “They took us from one forest to another. I couldn’t stand it,” Honorata said. “They called me the Queen, the one they publicly raped. They would put me on a cross, my head near the ground, and rape me one after the other”.Sexual violence is endemic in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it has become a tactic of war. Experts are at a loss to explain why the problem is so widespread. But according to the UN, in 2006 there were 27,000 reported cases of sexual violence in South Kivu Province alone, despite the presence of 17,000 UN troops in the country. Nobody knows how many of those violations are carried out against students or teachers.
