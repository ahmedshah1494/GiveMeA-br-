
Following earlier studies that UNESCO published in
2007 and 2010,3 it not only examines attacks on
schools, as previous research has done, but also
considers military use of education facilities and more
closely examines attacks on higher education.
The study’s four main aims are to: better inform
international and national efforts to prevent schools,
universities, students, teachers, academics and other
education staff from being attacked; encourage the
investigation, prosecution and punishment of the
perpetrators of attacks; share knowledge about
effective responses; and help those who have been
attacked to recover and rebuild their lives – as
Malala is doing – by providing recommendations for
action that the international community, governments
and armed non-state groups should adopt and
implement.
In July 2013, Malala addressed the UN General
Assembly and stressed the importance of protecting
education. ‘The terrorists thought that they would
change my aims and stop my ambitions,’ she said,
‘but nothing changed in my life, except this:
weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Let us pick up
our books and pens. They are our most powerful
weapons.’4

The main parts of Education under Attack 2014 are:
• a summary providing an overview of the main points and key recommendations;
• a methodology section outlining the methods used in the research and the principal challenges
faced;
• a global overview providing a more detailed picture of the scale, nature, motives and impact of
attacks on education and the variety of responses that are being, or could be, made;
• three thematic essays offering more depth about how schools and universities can best be
protected;
• profiles of the 30 most seriously affected countries, providing an insight into the context in
which attacks take place, a detailed record of reported attacks on education during 2009-2012
and an outline of attacks during the first nine months of 2013; and
• endnotes providing citations for every piece of information used in the study.

SUMMARY
his global study examines threats or deliberate use of
force against students, teachers, academics, education
trade union members, government officials, aid workers
and other education staff, and against schools, universities
and other education institutions, carried out for political,
military, ideological, sectarian, ethnic or religious reasons in
2009-2013; and military use of education buildings and facilities.

T

It focuses on targeted attacks by state military and security
forces and armed non-state groups on education facilities,
students or staff, not death, injury or destruction resulting from
being caught in crossfire.
It does not examine school attacks by lone armed individuals
with none of the above-listed motives or affiliations, such as the
school shooting at Sandy Hook in the United States in 2012.
