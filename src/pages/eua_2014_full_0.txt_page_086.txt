be prevented?
UN agencies, national and international civil society
organizations and national governments have
developed measures to protect education in situations of fragility, violence, repression, humanitarian
emergency and armed conflict.308 These range from
local initiatives to governmental and transnational
projects and reforms, and aim variously at protecting
civilian lives and education infrastructures, promoting
the right to education and academic freedom, and
preventing attacks from taking place. A 2011 GCPEA
study categorizes such measures as falling under four
groups: 1) protection; 2) prevention; 3) advocacy; and
4) monitoring.309 The focus of the study, and of the
majority of measures developed to date, has been on
situations affecting primary and secondary education,
but it may be possible to apply these to the protection
of higher education, while keeping in mind that many
attacks on higher education occur outside of conflict
situations and may therefore warrant specific
responses tailored to the sector.
Measures to protect higher education should focus on
increasing protection, prevention and accountability
through greater application of existing domestic and
international laws, and enhanced monitoring,
reporting, and domestic and international advocacy.

Protection and prevention measures
Restricting military use of university facilities
In countries such as Côte d’Ivoire,310 Somalia311 and
Yemen,312 state forces or armed non-state groups have
used universities for military purposes such as
weapons caches, strategic bases or training camps.
This increases the risk that attacks aimed at such
forces or groups might result in intentional or

collateral damage to facilities; and, if the university
continues to function despite being used for military
purposes, it increases the risk of harm to members of
higher education communities.313 This also undermines the autonomy of higher education institutions
and risks creating a perception that the institution and
its personnel are aligned with combatants, increasing
their vulnerability (discussed below). Protection
against such military use of universities and other
educational buildings is extensively covered later in
this report in the essay: ‘Military use of schools and
universities: changing behaviour’.314

Strengthening university autonomy
While there is extensive literature on the topic of
university autonomy, it is not often linked explicitly to
the issue of security from violent or coercive attacks.
However, recent work commissioned by GCPEA315
examines the relationship between autonomy and
security, and reflects on the security-enhancing
potential of university autonomy around the world.
The work lays out some of the ways in which
enhancing university autonomy vis-à-vis the state can
provide a possible model for reducing attacks on
higher education systems, particularly when coupled
with university-controlled internal security provision.
These ideas include developing and extending the
notion of the university as a space outside direct state
control (even when funding is largely state-provided),
including control of recruitment, financial and administrative management, curriculum and freedom of
research. It also extends to the prohibition of state
forces entering university campuses (unless invited in
by the institutional leadership or in extremely rare
circumstances). The authors argue that: ‘The ultimate
goal of all of these efforts should be to establish a
culture of autonomy and security, recognized not only
within the higher education sector but in the wider
society, in which higher education spaces are “off
limits” to attacks, freeing them to develop their
research and educational functions to their fullest and
to the maximum benefit of all.’316
The case of Colombia provides an illustrative example.
In response to campus demonstrations against higher
education reforms, successive Colombian governments have challenged the autonomy of university

space, arguing that the state has the right to intervene
in all national territory to protect its citizens. Similarly,
they have argued that armed non-state actors, particularly the guerrilla movements, are using the university
as a space for recruitment and incitement.317 Many
infringements of higher education space have
occurred over the past two decades, resulting in
violent clashes between students and state forces and
the deaths of several students.318
The authors of the GCPEA study note that to have full
protective effect, a culture of respect for institutional
autonomy must include not only the state but also
non-state actors and the academic community itself.
In Colombia, this broad culture has been undermined
by decades of violence, leaving the Colombian
academic community vulnerable to threats and
attacks by illegal paramilitary forces and their
successor groups, such as the Black Eagles.319
Meanwhile, the state, which has failed to provide
universities with full security from such attacks,
responds to them by limiting the universities’
autonomy. As the study notes, full respect for
autonomy requires more than the state refraining from
committing attacks. States also have a responsibility
to protect higher education communities from attack –
especially from para-state forces, insurgencies or
criminal gangs which are less likely to be subject to
the same pressures as states to comply with legal
norms and policies – but in ways that respect and
promote autonomy.

Physical protection of higher education
Increasing protection through defensive, physical
measures has been one of the traditional responses to
attacks on primary and secondary education, as cases
across a number of contexts show.320 Physical
protection strategies for higher education could
similarly include defensive reinforcement of infrastructure, such as installing bullet-proof windows and
blast-proof walls; installing security ramps and other
anti-suicide bombing measures (e.g. metal detectors,
security cameras and checkpoints);321 changing
lecture times to fit with arrival and departure in
daylight hours; escorting higher education professionals, students and education trade unionists en
route to and from university; and providing
