MALI
Some 130 schools were looted, destroyed or used by
armed groups and government forces during fighting in
the north of the country, notably in 2012 and early
2013. The conflict caused widespread disruption of
education.1041

Context
Conflict erupted in northern Mali in early 2012 when
Tuareg insurgents began pushing for autonomy. A
military coup in March undermined the government’s
response to the conflict, leading to considerable
political instability,1042 and by April the armed groups
had consolidated control over the northern regions of
Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal.1043
The Tuaregs drove the Malian army out of the north in
April 2012, formed an alliance with armed Islamist
groups – Ansar Dine, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb
and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa –
and declared the area to be an Islamic state. Ansar
Dine began imposing strict Sharia law and the armed
Islamist groups soon turned on their Tuareg allies,
taking control of most of northern Mali’s cities.1044 In
January 2013, after the armed Islamists launched an
offensive southward, the Malian government asked
France for assistance in driving back the armed
groups. Within several months, the joint efforts of the
French, Malians and other African troops had largely
cleared the Islamists from their strongholds.1045
The armed conflict in the north caused hundreds of
thousands of civilians to flee, including most teachers
and school administrators, and temporarily reversed
gains in education access and quality.1046 In February
2013, 86 per cent of pupils remaining in the north were
still without education.1047 By October 2013, tens of
thousands of civilians had returned to the northern
regions but the conflict, large-scale displacement and
the accompanying disruption of schooling adversely
affected education for hundreds of thousands of
children.1048
In 2011, net primary enrolment was 71 per cent, net
secondary enrolment was 34 per cent and gross
tertiary enrolment was 7 per cent.1049 Approximately 31
per cent of adults were literate.1050
