
Despite the worldwide engagement of communities in
protecting education, very little research, either
quantitative or qualitative, has taken place on the
outcomes of these actions.234 This essay summarizes
available documentation on this topic, based on a
review of existing literature and selected programme
documents as well as practitioner experience. The
analysis draws on the Interagency Learning Initiative’s
(ILI) typology of ways of engaging communities in
activities to achieve children’s well-being.235 The fourcategory typology of community participation in
protection interventions proposed by the ILI has been
adapted and used for this review: communityinitiated, community-implemented,
community-inspired and community-involved. The
analysis of community action presented draws, in
particular, upon two in-depth case studies of the
Philippines and Afghanistan prepared for this chapter.
Based on the review, suggestions are offered on ways
that national or international actors can support
community action.

Community action to prevent and
respond to attack
Communities are engaged in preventive, damagemitigating and responsive actions designed to ensure
continued safe access to education. These actions can
be undertaken independently or with varying degrees
of support from government, civil society or international organizations. Work at the community level is
facilitated through national-level education policies
that are conflict-sensitive and through curriculum
reform to remove bias and build students’ capacity for
conflict resolution. The present chapter, however,
examines only modalities of action specifically at
community level.

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Forms of education protection in which communities are engaged
Preventive actions, such as:
• strengthening management of education
• negotiation to prevent attacks
• establishing ‘Codes of Conduct’/’Schools as Zones of Peace’ with the
objective of long-term prevention of attacks
• awareness-raising on the value of education
• roll-out of, and awareness-raising on, national legislation
• advocacy
• adaptation of education delivery
• physical strengthening of schools, construction and reconstruction
• night guards/day guards/security
• protests

Damage mitigation, such as:
• contingency planning
• safety and first aid training
• extinguishing fires in case of arson attacks
• early warning systems: Short Message Service (SMS) warning teachers and
students of attack

Response actions, such as:
• facilitating speedy resumption of education when safety permits
• support for temporary learning spaces and psychosocial support
• monitoring and reporting
• capturing lessons learned in order to be able to carry out further preventive
action
• negotiation – e.g. for the clearing of school buildings used by armed
groups and state armed forces, or the release of teachers or students
• reconstruction and repairs
