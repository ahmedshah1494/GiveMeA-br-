Military use of schools

Child recruitment from schools

Between May 2008 and March 2010, armed groups
used at least 34 schools.1390 In some cases, multiple
groups occupied the same school at different times.
For example, Waaberi primary school located in Gedo
was used by TFG forces, ASWJ, Ethiopian Defence
Forces (EDF) and Al-Shabaab in August 2009. It was
used as a defensive fort, resulting in heavy damage to
the buildings.1391

When fighting intensified in Mogadishu in mid-2010,
Al-Shabaab increasingly recruited children from
schools in order to fill its dwindling ranks. Boys and
girls were recruited from schools by force as well as by
enticing them with propaganda and material
rewards.1400 A number of children interviewed by
Human Rights Watch in May and June 2011 reported
that Al-Shabaab members had taught in their classrooms, encouraging them to join the group and
promising ‘entry into paradise’ for those who died
fighting.1401

Military use of schools continued in 2011 and 2012.
According to the UN, Al-Shabaab used a school in
Elwak district, Gedo region, in August 2011, interrupting the education of over 500 children; the school
had been used intermittently by armed groups since
February 2011.1392 In December 2011, Al-Shabaab
militia established an operations centre at a
secondary school in Merka district, Lower Shabelle
region.1393 TFG forces also reportedly used schools in
Mogadishu.1394 A UN respondent reported that in 2012
at least five schools in the Bay, Gedo and Hiraan
regions of central and southern Somalia were
occupied or used as hospitals, police stations or
prisons by Al-Shabaab, EDF, Somali National Armed
Forces (SNAF) and regional authorities, affecting some
1,933 children.1395 In late May 2012, following the
takeover of the Afgooye corridor by AMISOM and TFG
forces, the TFG and its National Security Agency (NSA)
rounded up dozens of people and used the Afgooye
Secondary School as a base and a detention centre.1396
Schools were also used as firing bases. Al-Shabaab
launched artillery attacks from school grounds,
drawing return fire from TFG and AMISOM forces. In
some cases, students and teachers were inside.1397 For
example, Human Rights Watch reported that in 2010
Al-Shabaab fighters used a school in Mogadishu as a
firing position while students were still in the classrooms. Pro-government forces returned fire, and five
rockets hit the school compound. One rocket struck
just as the students were leaving, killing eight.1398
Al-Shabaab occupied some schools after they had
been closed due to insecurity, making it impossible for
classes to resume and risking damage or destruction
