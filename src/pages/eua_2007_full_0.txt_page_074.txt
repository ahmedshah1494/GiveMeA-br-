A protective symbol should be devised, akin to the red cross, and its use should be encouraged, to promote recognition of safe sanctuary status for schools, colleges and universities where the concept is accepted. Governments and the international community should promote political,   intercultural and interreligious dialogue, and intercultural education, to provide a supportive context in which schools can promote tolerance and understanding. Curricula should promote education for mutual understanding, appreciation of common as well as diverse heritage, conﬂ ict resolution, and non-propagandist history teaching methods. The international community, UN agencies and NGOs should work with   governments of conﬂ ict-affected states and governments that are assisting in preventing or limiting conﬂ ict to: Develop mechanisms to protect threatened students, teachers, academics,   education trade unionists and ofﬁ cials, and to assist them in relocating internally or externally where appropriateDevelop ways to support the continuation of education in alternative places   or via alternative methods and media in areas under attack Develop ways to support the continuation of the work of academics in exile   for the education system under attackRecognising the limitations of the current reporting system conducted by the   Ofﬁ ce of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Children in Armed Conﬂ ict, the United Nations should demonstrate its commitment to the right to education by setting up a global system for monitoring violent attacks on education, including attacks on teachers and academics, and support the establishment of a publicly accessible, global database to keep track of the scale of attack, types of attack, perpetrators, motives, impact on education provision and the nature and impact of prevention and response strategies. Methods of collection of data must avoid putting staff and students at further risk of attack and should cover all sectors of education.
