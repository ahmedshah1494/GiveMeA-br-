Some of the buildings were being used as defensive positions by South Ossetian forces.420During the ensuing Russian military operation in the same month, schools and a youth summer camp were bombed, shelled, burnt down, fired upon and looted, according to the Georgian Ministry of Education. Ninety-nine education institutions were reportedly destroyed or damaged by military action; and school furniture and learning materials were damaged, including school laboratories, libraries and computer equipment. An estimated 230 kindergartens, vocational education centres, schools, arts centres, special schools for children with disabilities, research institutions, higher education institutions and student dormitories were reassigned to shelter IDPs for up to a year.421 GuatemalaMembers of a team from the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation received death threats in February 2008. The foundation excavates mass graves to look for evidence of genocide and other crimes against humanity committed by the Guatemalan military during the 36-year-long civil war, which ended in 1996. The head of the foundation, Fredy Peccerelli, his colleagues and relatives had also received threats via text messages and emails in May and June 2007, warning that they were being watched and threatening them with rape, torture and death. Members of the team and their relatives had earlier been threatened in person – by gunmen pushing a gun against their head on the street, for instance – or by letter, warning them to stop their work.422
