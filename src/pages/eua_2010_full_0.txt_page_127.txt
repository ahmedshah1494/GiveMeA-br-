Subjective judgments made about what constitutes a disproportionate impact of an attack on education, when commanders are deciding whether it is legitimate to mount an attack, may be affected by the degree to which they see, feel or understand the impact on civilians and education. Would a judge determine the legitimacy of an attack that collaterally damages a school by how many walls were immediately destroyed, by how many children were traumatized for lengthy periods, or by the possible long-term effect on children’s education of teachers consequently refusing to work in the area? Education specialists and international organizations have a role to play in informing these decisions.There are also problems in determining whether the level of violence constitutes an armed conflict, whether combatants fit the definition of an organized armed group and whether such groups have sufficient degree of control over the territory in which the violations took place. One significant issue in IHL affecting attacks on education, however, is the exception that if civilians take part in hostilities or civilian buildings are used for military purpose - for example, as a base for soldiers or command post for military operations - they lose protected status. There are safeguards against this exception being falsely used to justify attacks: Those planning or authorizing an attack must do everything feasible to establish whether the targets are civilians or civilian objects. Legal advisers must be available to advise commanders on the lawfulness of the attack when it is being planned or authorized.Those who carry out the operation must stop the attack if it becomes apparent that the targets are civilians or civilian objects.301
