moharebeh (‘enmity with God’) has been defined very
broadly. For example, Mohammad Amin Valian, a 20year-old student who was active in the Islamic
Association, a student organization, was charged
with moharebeh and sentenced to death in February
2010 for his role in the post-2009 election protests.
His alleged crimes included shouting ‘Death to the
dictator’; being affiliated with the Central Council of
the Islamic Association of Damghan Science
University and statements published by them; and
organizing election debates at the university. He was
convicted based on evidence that included photos of
him at a demonstration in December 2009 throwing
rocks into an empty area.831 Following international
protests, the sentence was reduced to imprisonment
and a fine.832
After the 2009 post-electoral conflicts, cases of
prolonged detention without charge, arbitrary arrest
and sentencing of students and teachers for political
reasons continued to be recorded. In the three years
from March 2009, the Human Rights Commission of
the Iranian student association, Daftar Tahkim Vahdat,
identified instances of 436 arrests, 254 convictions
and 364 cases of denial of education.833 As of April
2012, some 31 students were still being held in
prison.834 The charges ranged from ‘putting up posters’
to attending an anti-government rally. Some were
given the additional sentence of ‘prison in exile’,
meaning they were sent to a distant prison.835
Omid Kokabee, a PhD student at the University of
Texas, was arrested while visiting his family in Iran in
2011 and was held for 15 months before being given a
verdict in a rushed trial in which no evidence was
presented, according to his lawyer. He was sentenced
to 10 years in prison for national security offences after
refusing to co-operate on scientific projects in Iran, his
lawyer said.836
Another student, Majid Tavakoli, was sentenced to
eight-and-a-half years after he spoke at a National
Students’ Day rally at Amirkabir University of
Technology in 2009.837 Charges against him included
‘participating in an illegal gathering’, ‘propaganda
against the system’ and ‘insulting officials’. Tavakoli
was convicted after an unfair trial, without a lawyer,
and was held for months in solitary confinement and
