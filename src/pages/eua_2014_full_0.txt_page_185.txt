Military use of schools
Numerous incidents were reported of government
forces, including the Syrian Armed Forces, the intelligence forces and the Shabbiha militia, using schools
either as temporary bases, military staging grounds,
sniper posts or detention and interrogation facilities.1559 The Syrian Network for Human Rights alleged
