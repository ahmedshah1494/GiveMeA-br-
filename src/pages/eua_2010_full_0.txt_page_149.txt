This requires investigations not only of individual cases but also of patterns within a particular chain of command that can establish accountability for such violations among senior commanders or officials.Action at the international level must be underpinned by action at national level. Governments should criminalize attacks on education in law. The international community should support the use of national, regional and international courts to bring perpetrators of attacks on education to account (for example via advocacy, sponsorship of legal scholarship on relevant subjects, and monitoring trials).Governments and the international community should consider ways to strengthen the protection of higher education in international humanitarian and human rights law.
