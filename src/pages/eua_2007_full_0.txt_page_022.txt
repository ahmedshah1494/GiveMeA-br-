A guerrilla soldier pointed his pistol at me and threatened to kill me if I didn’t go with them.”Henang (not his real name) was interviewed by Save the Children.59 He escaped after nine months, covered in scars from punishments. “I tried many times to get away. Every time I was caught and beaten by the commander. He always watched me, threatened me and hit me.”One evening, Henang killed the commander and escaped. But he was taken into army custody and pressured into revealing which villages had co-operated with the guerrillas and the army took retribution.Now he cannot go home in case he is treated as an informer and traitor. Instead, he lives in a rehabilitation and training centre supported by Save the Children.
