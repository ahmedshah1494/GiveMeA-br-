The countries very heavily affected — where reports
documented 1,000 or more attacks on schools, universities,
staff and students or 1,000 or more students, teachers or other
education personnel attacked or education buildings attacked
or used for military purposes in 2009-2012 — were

For example, during that time period:
• In Afghanistan, according to the UN, there were 1,110 or
more attacks on school-level education, including arson
attacks, explosions and suicide bombings. Staff were
threatened, killed and kidnapped.
• In Colombia, one of the most dangerous places to be a
teacher, 140 teachers were killed over these four years
and 1,086 received death threats, according to the
Ministry of Education. In addition, 305 were forced to
leave their homes because their lives were at risk,
according to the Escuela Nacional Sindical (ENS), a
prominent Colombian NGO monitoring labour rights.
• In Pakistan, armed groups, particularly the Pakistani
Taliban, attacked at least 838 schools, mostly by blowing
up school buildings, and deprived hundreds of
thousands of children of access to education, according
to primary research by the independent Human Rights
Commission of Pakistan. Some 30 school students and
20 teachers were killed and 97 school students and eight
teachers injured, and 138 school students and staff were
kidnapped. One higher education student and four
academics were killed, and dozens of university students
were injured.
