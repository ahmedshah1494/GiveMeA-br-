
example, in Salahaddin governorate, two secondary
school students were killed and another wounded
when five masked armed attackers entered the
school, made their way to a specific classroom and
shot at the students on 22 April 2012. The UN reported
that according to local sources, including local police,
AQI was allegedly behind the attack, some mentioning
that AQI had attempted to recruit the victims before
the incident.879 The UN also reported that 19 schoollevel education staff were killed or injured in 2012.880
On 12 March 2012, a teacher from the Riyadh district,
south of Kirkuk, died when a bomb attached to his car
exploded.881
Roadside bombs along school routes also killed or
wounded a number of students and teachers,
although they were not necessarily targeting
education. In one incident, Baghdad high school
students travelling by bus from Sadr City to sit their
final examinations were caught in a roadside bomb
explosion in June 2009. Police said that three pupils
were killed and 13 people wounded, although the US
army said there was one dead and eight injured.882 On
10 January 2012, three boys were killed by a roadside
bomb while leaving their school in Yathrib, near
Balad.883
Throughout 2009-2012, there were also several
instances of arrest or harassment of students,
teachers and teacher trade unionists. Ibrahim alBattat, a leader of the Iraqi Teachers’ Union, was
arrested and then released on 22 February 2010 after
an eight-day detention for his involvement in strikes
and his refusal to divulge union members’ names.884
On 26 February 2010, a warrant was also issued for
Jasim Hussein Mohammed, the national leader of the
Iraqi Teachers’ Union (ITU), who was subsequently
arrested and released.885

Attacks on higher education
Almost 500 Iraqi academics886 were killed in the nine
years from the fall of Saddam Hussein to April 2012,
but the vast majority of assassinations occurred
before 2009. Since then, attacks on higher education
have continued at a much lower rate, with 26 killings
recorded by media and human rights groups from
2009 to 2012. In two cases in 2010, professors who
had recently returned to Iraq from exile were killed,

contradicting the higher education ministry’s claims
that it was safe for academics to come back.887 UNAMI
reported the separate killings of six academics and the
combined kidnapping of two professors in 2011.888 The
majority of those killed were shot or targeted by explosions caused by magnetic or ‘sticky’ bombs, often
placed under vehicles, or other devices planted near
the victims’ homes. However, at least one professor
was stabbed to death and another was hanged after
unidentified attackers stormed his house.889 In
another incident in July 2011, the Director-General of
Iraq’s Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific
Research, Dawood Salman Rahim, was reportedly
assassinated, along with his son, in their car in west
Baghdad’s Ghazaliya district by a group of unknown
armed men.890
A compilation of media and human rights reports
suggests that as many as 20 higher education
students may have been killed and 115 injured
between 2009 and 2011. Of those killed, most were
reported to have been shot, many in drive-by
shootings in which the perpetrators and motives were
not known.891
In 2010, at least 100 students were injured when a
convoy of buses, escorted by Iraqi forces and transporting college students from Christian towns and
villages in the Nineveh Plain back to classes at the
University of Mosul, was attacked.892 A car bomb
exploded as the first buses crossed a checkpoint
along the internal border between the semiautonomous Kurdish region and the rest of the
country. Shortly afterwards, another roadside bomb
went off.893 The area around Mosul University had
already experienced several attacks and threats of
attacks in 2009, which is why students travelled in
these types of convoys.894 The attacks on Christian
students were part of a spate of dozens of attacks
against Christians in Iraq in 2010.895 According to
Worldwatch Monitor, nearly 1,000 students stayed
away from class for the rest of the semester as a result
of the convoy attack.896
Students in Kirkuk and the northern city of Mosul were
repeatedly targeted.897 In another incident on 11
August 2011, five Shiite university students were shot
dead by a drive-by assassin on a motorcycle while they

were swimming.898 On 6 June 2012, another student
was killed by a magnetic bomb attached to a
vehicle.899

Attacks on education in 2013
School drop-out rates in 2013 were the lowest for a
decade, which the education minister said resulted
from better security, removal of armed groups,
rebuilding of schools and increased recognition of the
value of education.900 However, there was an upturn in
the level of general violence in 2013,901 approaching
the levels of 2008, and there were numerous reports
of attacks on education, including against school
students,902 tertiary-level students,903 teachers,904
academics905 and education ministry officials.906 There
were multiple accounts of teachers being targeted
individually and some reports of large numbers of
students being killed. For example, on 6 October 2013,
a suicide bomber drove a truck full of explosives into
the wall of a primary school playground in Tel Afar,
north-west of Mosul, and detonated them, killing at
least 12 pupils and their head teacher.907
Attacks on higher education institutions and students
and academics continued. In January, Dr Abbas Fadhil
Al-Dulaimy, the President of Diyala University, survived
an assassination attempt in which his convoy was hit
by the detonation of a roadside bomb, which killed
two of his bodyguards.908 Tikrit University was
repeatedly targeted. In March, a bomb went off on its
campus, injuring five students.909 In June, a suicide
bomber attacked the campus, killing a police
officer.910 Four university staff members were also
reportedly killed in a bomb attack in March north of
Tikrit, but it is not clear whether they were targeted as
university staff members.911 In the most serious
incident affecting students, two suicide bombers blew
themselves up inside and outside Habib al-Asadi
Shiite mosque in Baghdad in June 2013, killing 34
people and injuring 57 others. Most victims were
students from the nearby Imam Al-Sadiq University for
Islamic Studies who regularly attended the mosque for
midday prayers, although it is not known if they were
being targeted.912
