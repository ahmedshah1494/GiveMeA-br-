An Amnesty International brieﬁ ng note60 on Nepal reported that Maoists had abducted “tens of thousands of schoolchildren, along with their teachers’ for ‘political re-education sessions”. Typically, the tactic was to enter a high school and force all the students and teachers to accompany them to a remote location where hundreds of children from across the area would be gathered. Many of the children would return after a few days but some would be held back for use as child soldiers – to be assigned such tasks as carrying bombs and ammunition, acting as messengers, or in some cases actually taking part in ﬁ ghting. Others were earmarked for future recruitment. Amnesty International concluded: “The scale and frequency of these abductions suggests that they are central to the CPN (Maoist) mobilization strategy.”
