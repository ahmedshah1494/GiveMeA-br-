students injured or arrested were involved in protests
on wider political issues.38 In one incident, some 450
student rooms at Omdurman Islamic University in
Khartoum were set on fire by security agents and
supporters of the National Congress Party.39 Some
students were reported to have been abducted by
security agents and tortured.40

containing the Ministry of Education and other
ministries killed more than 100 people, many of whom
were students and their parents. They were gathering
to obtain examination results needed for scholarships
to study abroad. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. In
a pre-recorded interview, their suicide bomber
reportedly condemned the education system and criticized students for wanting to study abroad.49 Another
suicide bombing at Benadir University’s graduation
ceremony in Mogadishu in 2009 killed 22 people,
including the ministers of education, higher education
and health, the dean of the medical school, professors
and students.50

In some countries, there were more than a thousand
schools destroyed but it was not clear how many were
targeted deliberately. During the civil conflict in Syria,
by September 2012, more than 2,000 schools had
been damaged or destroyed, according to UNICEF, and
by April 2013 that figure had risen to 2,445.41 Both
sides used schools either as military headquarters,
military bases or detention centres,42 and the Syrian
Network for Human Rights alleged that the
government had turned a thousand schools into
detention and torture centres.43 Human Rights Watch
presented evidence that schools had been deliberately targeted, in one case causing the death of 12
students.44 During Libya’s civil war in 2011, some
1,900 schools were damaged or destroyed. It is not
known how many were deliberately targeted, but at
least 221 were reportedly used by armed groups,
making them a potential target, and 27 deliberate
attacks on schools were documented, a figure which
the UN said reflected only a portion of all the incidents
that took place.45

Death threats and the threat of kidnap were mostly
directed at individuals but some were also directed at
large groups of students or teachers. In Mexico, for
instance, armed criminal groups threatened teachers
with kidnapping or other violence if they did not hand
over a portion of their salaries.51 In some cases,
individuals or individual schools were targeted52
while, in another, the entire teaching staff of a specific
education district was threatened.53

Other heavily affected countries — where there were
between 500 and 999 attacks, victims or affected
facilities — include: Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Iraq,
Israel/Palestine, Libya, Mexico and Yemen. For
instance, in Yemen, there were more than 720
incidents involving the use of force affecting schools,
school teachers and school students, although not all
of them were targeted attacks.46 These incidents
included looting, shelling, bombardment, military use
by armed forces or armed groups, arson and threats to
personnel.47 In Côte d’Ivoire, armed groups and
military forces destroyed, damaged, looted or used
480 schools and universities during 2010-2011 and 50
university students were attacked.48

In Afghanistan, for instance, the total number of
reported attacks on education fell dramatically after
2009.55 According to one piece of research, an
apparent change in the Taliban’s policy on attacking
schools was believed to have resulted from the
Taliban’s gradual transformation into a militarypolitical insurgency, its concern to respond to
community pressure regarding schools, and an
apparent increasing willingness on the government’s
part to negotiate with the Taliban and agree concessions on education.56 However, evidence that attacks
on schools increased in 2012 and spread to new areas
threw into question the reality of that supposed policy
change.57

Some of the most devastating and high-profile
incidents occurred in Somalia, where, for example, in
October 2011, a suicide attack at a compound

Some countries that were previously heavily affected,
such as Nepal,58 are no longer experiencing a pattern
of attacks on education. In Nepal’s case, the number
