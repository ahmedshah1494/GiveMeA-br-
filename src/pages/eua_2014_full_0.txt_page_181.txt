
Riot police initially injured at least 20 students and
arrested scores during a campus rally on 22 December
2011. They raided dormitories and detained 16 more
students that evening and arrested more than 100
students in a student residential compound the next
morning as demonstrations continued.1499 Some
students were injured in the arrests.1500 Several days
later, police reportedly took into custody at least 70
more when they broke up another sit-in, using tear
gas, batons and warning shots to disperse
students.1501 The university was closed on 29
December but the sit-in continued. By 1 January 2012,
three student leaders and at least four other students
had been arrested.1502 More than 300 students
continuing to stay at the university were reportedly
arrested on 17 February 2012 in pre-dawn raids on
dormitories. The university remained closed until midMarch 2012.1503
Student demonstrations were similarly suppressed at
Gezira University in early December 2012, when
authorities shut down the university after four Darfuri
students were found drowned in a nearby canal. The
four had been arrested, along with at least 50 other
students, while participating in a peaceful sit-in over
tuition fees, according to the Darfur Students
Association (DSA).1504 Dozens of other students were
reportedly injured in the first sit-in,1505 and an
additional 60 were injured in fighting between police
and students during the demonstrations that occurred
after the bodies were found.1506 The violence spread to
other universities. On 11 December 2012, in protests at
Omdurman Islamic University in Khartoum over the
same issue, around 140 students were arrested,
another 180 injured, 450 student rooms burned down,
and laptops and mobile phones allegedly looted by
security agents and supporters of Sudan’s ruling
National Congress Party (NCP).1507
Other students were similarly targeted during and
after protests or meetings at academic institutions.
Examples include the arrest on 20 April 2011 of 17
students affiliated with the United Popular Front, a
political party supporting Abdul Wahid Al Nour, a
Darfuri rebel leader, from the campus of their
university, Al Nilein, after they held a demonstration
calling for regime change in Khartoum;1508 and the
arrest on 17 January 2012 of 11 student members of the

Democratic Unionist Party following a public talk at the
Faculty of Engineering in the University of the Nile
Valley in Al Damer.1509 Forty-two Darfuri students
reportedly resigned from the Red Sea University in
protest over arrests and harassment by security
services.1510
Students, primarily of Darfuri background, were
attacked at academic events and in academic spaces
and sometimes subsequently tortured or killed. On 11
March 2009, for example, a group identified as current
and former students and NISS officials disrupted an
authorized student forum attended by approximately
200 students at Dilling University. Ten students were
injured after being hit with sticks and iron bars.1511
Additionally, on 11 June 2009, 15 female Darfuri
students at the University of Khartoum were assaulted
by men dressed in black abayas, who had reportedly
entered their dormitory. The NISS detained many of
the women who had been assaulted, along with
others living in the same dormitory. Five of those
injured sought medical treatment at a hospital but
police forced them to leave.1512
In other cases, students of Darfuri origin and Darfur
activists were allegedly tortured by state agents. For
instance, the NISS seized a Darfuri student of the
Department of Education at the University of Khartoum
in front of the campus in early February 2010. His body,
found the next day in a street in Khartoum, showed
signs of torture, and the NISS sought to have it buried
without an autopsy, according to Amnesty
International.1513 Similarly, the body of another
student, reportedly abducted by NISS agents from the
University of Khartoum and found on 18 June 2011,
showed signs of torture; the previous day, the student
had delivered a speech about the situation in Darfur.
The NISS denied involvement.1514
Disputes between rival student movements also
turned violent. Between October 2010 and May 2012,
several clashes occurred between students
supporting rival political movements that left at least
20 students wounded,1515 one of them critically. For
example, at Nyala University, some eight students
were injured in violence between NCP-affiliated
students, who were supported by security personnel,
and pro-Sudan Liberation Movement students.1516

In another incident, on 24 May 2010, an armed group
believed to be an NCP-influenced student organization broke up an engagement party in the female
dormitories at Dalnaj University, allegedly at the
request of a dormitory supervisor. The group beat the
women with iron sticks and critically wounded a thirdyear student in the Faculty of Science. According to the
Sudan Human Rights Monitor, the student was
reportedly denied medical care by the Students
Support Fund and the dormitory administration, and
later died. The next day, a group of students demonstrating in solidarity with their peers was fired at with
live ammunition and tear gas by police forces. Two
students were killed and at least 20 injured.1517
Security services also targeted professors,
researchers and campus speakers perceived to be
undertaking controversial research or making antigovernment remarks. According to the African Centre
for Peace and Justice Studies, on 24 November 2011,
the NISS arrested and raided the offices of members of
an AIDS prevention group from Al Gezira University
that had just carried out a survey on the prevalence of
HIV and AIDS. The members were released later in the
day, but all reports and data related to the survey
conducted were confiscated and the Director-General
of the Ministry of Health suspended the research.1518
On 20 February 2012, NISS agents arrested Professor
Mohamed Zain Al-bideen, Dean of the College of
Higher Education at the University of Al Zaiem Al
Azhari in Omdurman, while leaving his university
office, and interrogated him about an article he had
written that was critical of Sudan’s President. He was
held for 15 days in a small cell and denied contact with
his family as well as a lawyer, before being released
without charge.1519

Attacks on education in 2013
During the first half of 2013, SAF aerial bombardment
of civilian targets, primarily in South Kordofan but also
in North Darfur, damaged or destroyed several
schools, injuring at least one student in the
process;1520 shelling in the area of Dresa, north-east of
East Jebel Marra, North Darfur, reportedly razed one
school to the ground in January.1521 It is not known if
these were targeted attacks.
