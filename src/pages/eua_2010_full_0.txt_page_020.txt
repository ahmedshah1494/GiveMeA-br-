If education organizations were to participate in the monitoring by joining or supporting the work of MRM country-level Task Forces and to push for action, such commitments could be made under the remit set by the Security Council.But there is also a need for programmes to support capacity development for education-oriented organizations to enable them to monitor attacks and support protection and recovery. Attacks on trade unionists, higher education students and academics, education officials and education aid workers are not covered by the MRM because it applies only to violations against children in armed conflict. Currently there is no systematic mechanism for gathering information on attacks against these groups, many of which take place outside conflicts. International cooperation is needed to establish effective monitoring of the full range of attacks on education.Tackling impunityThe problem of lack of prosecution of those responsible for attacks on education has vexed the international community since the publication of Education under Attack (2007). Key questions raised in the UN General Assembly debate (18 March 2009) included: What more needs to be done to ensure that perpetrators are actually investigated, tried and made to pay a heavy price? Is the lack of progress due to gaps in the coverage of attacks on education by international law or the monitoring processes that can inform investigators? If not, what can be done to ensure that the law is used to investigate such attacks and prosecute perpetrators?The advice of legal experts is clear on this point: most attacks on education are already adequately covered by existing laws and conventions, even if there is not as much visibility in the wording as exists for attacks on hospitals.
