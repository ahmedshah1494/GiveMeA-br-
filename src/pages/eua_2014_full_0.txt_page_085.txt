both supporters of, and threats to, the power and
legitimacy of state and non-state actors. Thus they can
be targeted for a number of reasons, falling under
three main categories, each of which is broadly

academic community.307 They may also have a serious
impact on wider issues of access to, and quality of,
education at all levels, in both the short and long term,
