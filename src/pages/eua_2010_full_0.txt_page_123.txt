Without them, budgets will not be set, supplies will not arrive, teachers will not be paid, national standards will not be devised and enforced, curricula will not be developed, teachers will not be trained, and the education process will grind to a halt. Attacks on individual officials or administrative buildings are an attack on the capacity of the education system to function. Therefore, it is important that attacks on officials are also monitored.Towards global monitoring of attacks on educationThere are two ways to increase reporting of attacks on education. One is to intensify and broaden the scope of reporting by the MRM to include non-physical attacks and, particularly, the impact of attacks on education on the school system. Zama Coursen-Neff of Human Rights Watch has suggested that country-level education clusters could play a positive role in helping to put education-oriented information systems in place and in developing methods of collecting standardized information.289The other way is to encourage the development of a truly systematic global monitoring system on this issue, to which the MRM could contribute relevant data, but which would cover all sectors of education and feed into an annual report similar to Education under Attack 2010. It would mean building a coalition of international, regional and national partners, across all education sub-sectors, willing to seek and provide data year after year so that trends and impact could be tracked both globally and within particular contexts.For their part, the networks devoted to assisting endangered scholars and education trade unionists could contribute to monitoring and reporting by investing in analysis of the considerable number of reports of incidents reaching them concerning academics and education trade unionists and by publishing the information.Perhaps education organizations that are encouraged to participate in the MRM could additionally be persuaded to extend their reporting to cover the full range of attacks - where they have the means to do so - for use by a global monitoring system.
