The UN said it had given the Israeli authorities the exact coordinates of UNRWA facilities, precisely to avoid such slaughter. Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary-General, said: “I am deeply dismayed that despite these repeated efforts, today’s tragedies have ensued. These attacks by Israeli military forces which endanger UN facilities acting as places of refuge are totally unacceptable”.161 At the time, Israeli authorities asserted that Hamas was using Gaza schools as sites for launching rocket attacks on Israeli towns, though UN investigators said they had found no evidence to support this claim.162 Israeli investigators concluded months later that in the al Fakhura incident Israeli troops had instead been attacking a Hamas mortar launching position 80 metres west of the school.163Hours before the al Fakhura attack, three young men, all cousins, died when Israeli forces bombed Asma Elementary School. Israeli investigators later alleged that a terrorist unit was present in the school, preparing to carry out military activities against IDF forces, and that the IDF had not been told that the school, previously closed for nine days, had been re-opened to shelter civilians.164However, the shellings were part of a pattern of attacks made on education buildings that destroyed or damaged 302 of them.A reported 250 students and 15 teachers were killed and hundreds more were injured in military strikes. Some students were injured by shattered glass while taking examinations; others were killed while waiting for the bus home.
