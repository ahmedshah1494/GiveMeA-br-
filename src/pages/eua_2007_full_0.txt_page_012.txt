4. Targets and motives The motives for attacks vary between conﬂ icts and within conﬂ icts, and can be multi-layered. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, many of the assaults against girls’ schools or those who work in them are carried out by extremist Islamic groups thought to be allied to the Taliban or Al Qaeda. Their motive is reportedly an ideological belief, rooted in an interpretation of religion and local traditions, that the education of girls should be forbidden. However, the forced closure of schools may also have a military objective of spreading fear and instability to undermine the authority of the state locally. A burning could also be an act of revenge or a show of strength in a rivalry between warlords, or armed groups exploiting jealousy over the building or repair of a school in a rival village. In Iraq, institutions are targeted in some cases on a sectarian basis because they are in an area dominated by Sunnis or Shia Muslims, but also because factions believe they will have a better chance of creating the conditions in which they can seize control of the country if they can drive out the intellectuals through fear and violence. Some academics are assassinated by Shia militants because they are suspected of collaborating with the regime under Saddam Hussein, others are killed by Sunnis
