Types of attacks
This study focuses on violent attacks on education:
threats or deliberate use of force against students,
teachers, academics and any other education
personnel, as well as attacks on education buildings,
resources, materials and facilities, including
transport. These attacks may be carried out for
political, military, ideological, sectarian, ethnic or
religious reasons.
The common thread is that these incidents involve the
deliberate use of, or threat to use, force in ways that
disrupt, harm or deter the provision of education and
enjoyment of the right to education.
The study additionally reports on the use of schools
for military purposes or security operations by armed
forces, or police or other security forces, or by armed
non-state groups, including rebel forces or any other
armed military, ethnic, political, religious or sectarian
group. This is an issue of concern because the military
use of education buildings and facilities can turn them
into a target for attack and can displace students,
teachers, academics and other education personnel,
thereby serving to deny students access to education.
It also reports on some aspects of systematic denial of
the right to education by the state or armed non-state
groups, for instance, where a government punishes
student involvement in political protests by
preventing participants from continuing their studies
or where armed groups issue edicts ordering schools
to close or stay closed.
Some incidents that do not involve direct violence are
reported if they represent a denial of education
imposed by force. An illustrative example is the
unilateral imposition by the Israeli Defence Forces
(IDF) of a firing range within a few hundred metres of a
school in Janiba village in the West Bank in 2012
putting children at risk and the future of the school in
doubt;Â teachers were arrested on their way to classes
because they had entered the firing zone even though
the IDF had not informed them that the firing range
had been established near their school.6
