2012, at least 11 schools were partially damaged or
destroyed by improvised explosive devices or
arson.1596 Direct attacks on military outposts set up on
school grounds were also reported.1597
Some arson cases were linked to specific political
activities. For instance, on 13 March 2009, two schools
were destroyed by insurgents in Pattani, as authorities
boosted security for the anniversary of the founding of
the BRN separatist group.1598 Other attacks on schools
appeared to be a means to target soldiers or police
officers. On 18 April 2012, Ban Ta Ngo School in Cho Ai
Rong district, Narathiwat, was set ablaze on the eve of
the Deputy Prime Minister and army chief’s visit to the
area. An explosive was then set off by remote control
targeting the team of soldiers and police who
responded to the attack.1599 In other cases, the school
itself seemed to be the target. On 29 November 2012,
a two-storey building was burned down by insurgents.
The building contained the school director’s office,
computer rooms and 11 classrooms.1600
The majority of arson attacks on schools occurred
overnight, when students and staff were not present.
However, there were some exceptions. On 3 December
2012, a group of 15-20 insurgents entered Ban Thasu
School in Panare district during the night, tied up a
temporary staff member and set fire to the school.1601
Several bombs were detonated on school premises; in
some cases, they appeared to be intended to attack
units of soldiers assigned to protect teachers. Five
teachers and two defence volunteers were wounded
by a bomb at the entrance of a school in Muang
district, Yala, on 25 July 2012. The explosive was
hidden in an iron box in front of the school.1602 In other
cases, bombs were found hidden inside fire extinguishers1603 and other spaces in or near schools. On 27
May 2012, insurgents detonated a bomb hidden in a
rest area inside Ban Kalapor School in Pattani’s
Saiburi district. The bomb was for an ambush
targeting a paramilitary unit that escorted teachers
and students. Two soldiers were killed and four others
seriously wounded. The school was closed down
immediately after the attack. Although the school was
reopened two days later, most parents refused to
bring their children back for nearly a week.1604 In
another case, on 24 September 2012, a bomb
