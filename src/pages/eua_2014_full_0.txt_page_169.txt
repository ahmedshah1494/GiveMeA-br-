
and were often used as temporary barracks or for other
military purposes ranging from a period of one week to
more than a year.1317
For instance, according to the UN, the Armed Forces of
the Philippines and its Citizen Armed Force
Geographical Units used functioning schools as
weapons and ammunition stores in 20101318 and, in
2011, used at least 14 schools during the course of
counterinsurgency operations.1319 Troops slept in
teacher housing and also used several classrooms at
Nagaan Elementary School in Mindanao for at least
seven months.1320 In 2012, the UN verified four
incidents involving the stationing of national armed
forces’ military units in public elementary schools in
Mindanao, as well as the establishment of a
detachment next to Salipongan Primary School in
Tugaya municipality, Lanao del Sur province, that
closed the school for two weeks.1321

Attacks on higher education
Media reports documented several attacks or
attempted attacks on university buildings and
grounds, including one related to use of the buildings
as polling stations: on an election day in 2010, two
bombs exploded at Mindanao State University where
several polling stations were based.1322
In August 2012, the main campus of Mindanao State
University was sealed off by the Armed Forces of the
Philippines after gunmen opened fire in an attack
inside the campus during which three soldiers were
killed and 10 others wounded.1323

Attacks on education in 2013
Abduction and killing of teachers were reported in
2013. Three teachers and three head teachers were
reported to have been shot dead or in one case shot
and ‘disappeared’ in separate incidents.1324 Mostly,
the attackers were unidentified and the motives were
not confirmed. In one of the incidents, on 22 January,
Sheikh Bashier Mursalum, a respected Muslim
scholar and the principal of a madrassa, was
reportedly shot and abducted by suspected state
security agents in Zamboanga City; he remained
missing at the end of August.1325 On 31 July, it was
reported that Abu Sayyaf Group rebels had released
abductee Alrashid Rojas, an employee of Western

Mindanao State University, and head teacher
Floredeliza Ongchua, who had been forcibly taken
from her home by 13 men in June.1326
On 11 September, during a battle between Muslim
insurgents and the Philippine army in Zamboanga,
soldiers used a school as a base for an unspecified
period.1327 In September, Bangsamoro Islamic
Freedom Fighters used nine teachers as human
shields during fighting with government forces after
earlier holding 13 teachers and some students
hostage at a school.1328
In higher education, a bomb planted by unknown
militants exploded on the University of Southern
Mindanao campus, causing widespread panic among
staff and students.1329

RUSSIA
The main threat to education came in the Caucasus,
where schools were attacked and teachers and
academics were murdered.1330

Context
Teachers, academics and religious scholars in Russia
have been targeted for assassination by suspected
armed Islamist militants seeking to impose their
religious views.
Vladimir Putin has held the political reins since
December 1999, during which time the country faced
increasing attacks by Islamist insurgents in the
northern Caucasus. The militants’ objective was a
regional emirate based on Sharia law.1331
The issue of whether students should be allowed to
wear headscarves was contentious in parts of
Russia.1332 Official permission to wear a headscarf in
school was granted by the government of Dagestan, a
mainly Muslim republic, in September 2013, whereas
in the nearby Stavrapol Region, the ban had been
upheld by the Supreme Court five months earlier.1333
Russia’s net primary enrolment was 93 per cent,1334
gross secondary enrolment was 89 per cent1335 and
gross tertiary enrolment was 76 per cent (2009).1336
Adult literacy was 100 per cent (2010).1337

Attacks on schools
From 2009 to 2012, at least three schools were
attacked.1338 As noted below (in Military use of
schools), two schools were attacked as an apparent
response to their designated use by government
forces.1339 In June 2009, militants reportedly fired
grenades at a school in Grozny, Chechnya. The
reasons were not known.1340
Separately, at least four bomb and gun attacks in the
vicinity of schools were identified in the North
Caucasus.1341 In one incident, alleged terrorists
exploded several bombs near School No.1 in Kizlyar,
Dagestan, in March 2010, killing 12 people and
injuring around 30; however, no students from the
school were reported dead or injured.1342

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
During the period 2009-2012, five teachers were killed
in Dagestan, several of them by suspected Islamist
insurgents, the others by unidentified assailants,
according to news reports.1343 In one case, a physical
education teacher, opposed to extreme Islamist
beliefs, was cut down by sub-machine gunfire as he
left a mosque after praying, in Tsbari village, Tsuntin
region, in June 2012.1344 In at least two cases, head
teachers were reported to have been assassinated
because they were against the wearing of headscarves
or hijab at school.1345 In one of these incidents, a head
teacher was shot dead in July 2011 by two assassins in
front of his family in the courtyard of his home in the
village of Sovyetskoye near the Azeri border,
Dagestan.1346

Military use of schools
Two schools were set aside for use as military bases
during 2009-2012: in June 2012, suspected armed
militants burned down one school and then attacked
another in Tsyntuk village, Dagestan, apparently
because government forces had earmarked them for
use as bases for counter-insurgency security operations.1347

Attacks on higher education
Five academics and scholars were shot dead or killed
in explosions by armed Islamist militants.1348 In
