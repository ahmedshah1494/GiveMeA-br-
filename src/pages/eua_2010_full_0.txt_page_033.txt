However, there have been reports of children being voluntarily or forcibly recruited from school, or en route to or from school, over the period from 2006 to 2009 in the following countries: Afghanistan, Burundi, Chad, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the occupied Palestinian territory, the Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Thailand. Fear of recruitment by this method has also reportedly driven parents in Venezuela, on the Colombian border, and in Sri Lanka to keep their children home from school. In the same period, in Zimbabwe children were coerced into joining the ZANU-PF youth militia and some children were forced to work for the Army.32 Sexual violence against schoolgirls and women has increasingly become a characteristic of conflict. It reached acute levels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2006 and continued at high levels from 2007 to 2009, with 2,727 reported cases of sexual violence against children in Oriental Province in 2008, perpetrated mainly by members of armed groups but also by soldiers and national police officers.33 Boys, too, are victims of sexual violence in some conflicts. The UN cited the high incidence of rape and sexual violence against children in Burundi, Chad, the Central African Republic, Côte D’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Somalia and Sudan as of particular concern.34 As with child soldier recruitment, it is not known what proportion of incidents occur as a result of abduction from or attacks at schools or other education institutions, or on the way to or from them. Human rights and media reports and evidence provided by aid workers suggest this has occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Indonesia, Iraq, Myanmar and the Philippines during the reporting period, but more research is needed to establish whether it is a common tactic.35 An obstacle to obtaining accurate data may be the reluctance of victims to report such incidents.

31 Other methods of recruitment include abducting children from market places, from homes, or from the street. Many children are recruited in camps for refugees or IDPs, although there are no figures on how many are taken from schools in the camps or via other methods.32 For details, see Country Reports in Annex I.33 UNSC, Report of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict (2009).34 Radhika Coomaraswamy, Annual Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, UNGA A/HRC/12/49, July 30, 2009.35 For details, see individual Country Reports in Annex I.
