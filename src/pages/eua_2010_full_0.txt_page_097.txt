The police arranged transport to and from the meeting.226Others measures employed in the two provinces included communities banning strangers from entering their village, hiring night guards or patrolling schools themselves, particularly after the receipt of night letters (threats). Even when they were not able to deter an attack, night guards were in some cases able to limit the damage by stopping schools or tented classrooms from burning down afterwards. In some cases, they or community members fought with attackers.227A stronger message coming from the CARE research is that clear community involvement in the running of schools seems to be correlated with a reduced likelihood of attack and a greater chance of achieving negotiated prevention. Evidence supporting this includes the following: Sixty-five per cent of respondents from communities with a school that was not attacked said the community requested the building of the school, but only 56 per cent of respondents from villages where the school was attacked said the same; seven per cent of respondents from areas where a school was not attacked said the community did not request the school, while 17 per cent of respondents from areas where a school was attacked said the same.228Eighty-five per cent of respondents see protection as the responsibility of the community; 45 per cent say responsibility lies with the government and 32 per cent say responsibility lies with the police. The Afghan National Army and international military forces are seen as irrelevant to protection.229The hiring of guards for schools or other defence measures by the community send a message that the schools are “for the people and not for the government”, so should not be a targeted as a symbol of government.230The perception that the curriculum is anti-Islamic is a common reason for attack cited in the UNICEF incident database.231A Ministry of Education field assessment in Logar indicated that schools funded by the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (which include Afghan and
