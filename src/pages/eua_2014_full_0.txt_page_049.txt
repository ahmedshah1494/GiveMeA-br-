higher education were connected to a government’s
desire to prevent the growth of opposition
movements, restrict political debate or criticism of
policies, and prevent alternative points of view from
being expressed or gaining support. Others related to
government authorities’ wish to restrict education
trade union activity, silence student protests, prevent
certain subjects being researched by academics
(ranging from human rights issues to concerns about
HIV/AIDS) or limit the influence of, or exposure to,
foreign ideas.
As with attacks on schools, students and teachers,
there were also cases of sectarian attacks and ethnic
groups being targeted. In Sudan, for example,
unknown men attacked 15 Darfuri students in their
dormitory at Khartoum University in 2009.106 In
Ethiopia, in June 2012, security forces reportedly
stormed dormitories and arrested engineering
students at Haromaya University in Oromia to break up
a demonstration and held them outside without food
for two days.107
In addition, attacks on higher education were carried
out as a show of strength or in retaliation for military
gains unrelated to education. The Taliban said they
launched a double suicide bombing on the
International Islamic University in Islamabad on 20
October 2009, which killed two female and three male
students, in retaliation for a Pakistani army offensive
in South Waziristan.108 During Operation Cast Lead in
Gaza at the turn of 2008-2009 (27 December-18
January), Israeli forces damaged 14 of the 15 higher
education institutions in the Gaza Strip, destroying
three colleges and six university buildings.109 The
action appeared to be part of a strategy of destroying
enemy infrastructure, as reportedly declared by the
Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff.110

Long-term impact of attacks on education
There is a dearth of research quantifying the long-term
impact on education of the types of attack
documented in this study. In some countries,
education authorities or international NGOs have
documented the immediate impact, such as the
number of schools damaged or destroyed, or the
number of teachers or students killed or injured, but
