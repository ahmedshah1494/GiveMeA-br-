
remain unknown. These incidents appeared to be
linked to intra-trade union rivalries over the control of
education in Oaxaca state as part of the wider struggle
between those for and against more autonomy for the
indigenous population.1098

Attacks on higher education
Attacks on higher education included kidnappings
and murder of students and academics by gunmen;
bombings aimed at nanotechnology researchers and
facilities; and violence by police or security forces
against students.
Killings and kidnappings of students and staff
A compilation of media reports suggests that seven
academics or university personnel were murdered,1099
four were injured1100 and six were threatened;1101 in
addition, at least 15 higher education students were
killed,1102 one was tortured and four were injured.1103
Some kidnappings ended in the victims being
killed.1104 In some cases, it could not be verified
whether the crime was linked to the victim’s education
role or place of education. According to the Justice in
Mexico Project, the level of violence reportedly caused
some professors at the National Autonomous
University of Mexico, where three professors were
killed in a year, to leave their positions.1105
At least seven higher education students were
kidnapped.1106 In one incident on 5 March 2012, three
technical school students and one high school
student, aged between 13 and 21, were abducted from
their schools by heavily armed men and killed in
Cuernavaca, Morelos, in central Mexico. Their
dismembered bodies were found in plastic bags
together with a message from a drug cartel.1107
Anti-nanotechnology bombings
In 2011, according to a compilation of media reports,
six university campuses or research institutes were
targeted with bombings and one researcher was
separately assassinated in violence allegedly directed
at staff involved in nanotechnology research.1108 A
group called ‘Individuals Tending towards the Wild’
(ITS or ‘Individuales tendiendo a lo salvaje’ in
Spanish) reportedly claimed responsibility for seven
bombings and the assassination.1109

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

For instance, on 8 August 2011, two professors at the
Monterrey Institute of Technology were wounded
when a package containing a tube of dynamite in a 20
centimetre-long pipe exploded. ITS, which was also
linked to attacks against nanotechnology in France
and Spain, claimed responsibility.1110 The group was
reportedly motivated by a fear that development of
nanotechnology could lead to nanoparticles reproducing uncontrollably and threatening life on Earth.1111
According to Nature magazine, ITS also claimed
responsibility for two bomb attacks against the head
of engineering and nanotechnology at the Polytechnic
University of the Valley of Mexico in Tultitlán in April
and May 2011, the first of which wounded a security
guard.In May 2011, ITS issued a general threat to
professors and students warning them about any
suspicious packages on campus: ‘because one of
these days we are going to make them pay for everything they want to do to the earth’.1112

Attacks on education in 2013
At least six teachers were killed in 2013 for reasons
that were never established. 1118 For example, on 10
September in Acapulco, it was reported that teacher
José Omar Ramírez Castro had been shot and killed
less than 10 metres from his school as he went to give
his class, sparking a strike by 144 teachers over
insecurity and disrupting the education of over 10,000
students.1119 Threats of kidnap and extortion against
teachers also continued, with, for example, one
school in the state of Morelos responding by moving
teachers from one school to another to reduce the
possible targeting of specific teachers.1120 Police were
alleged to have used excessive force and illegally
detained protesters when they used electric batons to
disperse 300 teachers and students demonstrating
against education reforms in Veracruz in
September.1121 In higher education, attacks against
nanotechnology researchers persisted.1122

After the Monterrey bombing, the group reportedly
listed five more researchers it was targeting at the
Institute and six other universities.1113 The group also
claimed responsibility for the killing of Ernesto
Mendéz Salinas, a researcher at the Biotechnology
Institute of the National Autonomous University of
Mexico (UNAM) in November 2011.1114

Schools were attacked by state armed forces in ethnic
conflicts, and students and teachers were targeted
during an upsurge of sectarian violence between
Buddhists and Muslims in 2013.1123

Human rights violations by police and security forces

Context

One university student was wounded when police
fired warning shots at a student demonstration
against violence and the militarization of responses to
violence, in front of the Ciudad Juárez Autonomous
University Institute for Biomedical Sciences on 29
October 2010.1115

Since 1948 when British colonial rule ended, armed
ethnic groups have sought greater autonomy. The
democratic elections in 2010 led to ceasefires with
several groups in 2011-2012 and with the Kachin
Independence Organization (KIO) in 2013.1124 However,
threats to education persisted as ethnic and religious
violence between Buddhists and Muslims, the
descendants of Indian Muslims who arrived under
British rule, has continued to erupt periodically.1125

In another incident, on 12 December 2011, police fired
live ammunition while dispersing around 300 or more
student teachers blocking the motorway outside
Chilpancingo. They were demanding better resources
for rural education. The police killed two protesters
and injured three others. One of the protesters was
detained and tortured.1116
On 19 March 2010, military personnel killed two
students as they left the campus at Monterrey Institute
for Technology, planted firearms on their bodies and
falsely claimed they were ‘hit men’.1117
