
Attacks on higher education
On 21 May 2010, a prominent imprisoned Burmese
student, Kyaw Ko Ko, was sentenced to an additional
five years for ‘illegal association and subversion’
because of a speech he had given to students in front
of Rangoon City Hall in 2007. Kyaw Ko Ko, who has
since been released and is acting as chairperson of
the All Burma Federation of Student Unions,1138 was
originally arrested for ‘possessing politically sensitive
videos’ and ‘trying to reorganize the students’
union’.1139

Attacks on education in 2013
Education in Myanmar faced a new and violent threat
from Buddhist nationalists in central and eastern
regions in 2013, as schools and students were
attacked in outbursts of sectarian violence. On 17
February, it was reported that around 300 Buddhists
had attacked an Islamic religious school in Thar-Kay-Ta
township, Rangoon,1140 and later another Muslim
school was burned down in Lashio.1141 During 20 to 21
March, while armed security forces allegedly stood by,
a mob of more than 200 Buddhists torched an Islamic
school in Meiktila and killed 32 Muslim students and
four teachers; many of them were clubbed, drenched
in petrol and burned alive, and one was decapitated,
after trying to evade the attackers by hiding in bushes
nearby. Seven Buddhists were later jailed in
connection with the school massacre.1142
One month later, in July, it was reported that 15
students had been refused permission to attend
university in person because they had been absent
through imprisonment for fighting for democracy. They
were allowed only to resume their studies via
distance-learning courses.1143

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

NIGeRIA
Many schools were bombed, set on fire or attacked by
militants in the north – and increasingly militants
turned their attention to students and teachers. Dozens
of school teachers were murdered, and at universities
there were very heavy casualties in attacks by gunmen
firing indiscriminately and in some cases also using
bombs.1144

Context
After Nigeria’s return to civilian rule in 1999, it suffered
ongoing inter-communal, political and sectarian
violence which had claimed the lives of more than
15,700 people by 2011.1145 The unrest, which continued
into 2013, was seen by observers as being underpinned by endemic corruption, poverty, poor
governance, unchecked violence by the security
services and discrimination against ethnic
minorities.1146
Misuse of public funds was seen as having a devastating impact on education quality and on attempts to
widen access to education.1147 Considerable disparities in access and quality existed among Nigeria’s
states, with education levels generally lower in the
north.1148 There remained an enduring distrust of
Western education dating back to British colonial rule
when missionary schools were largely kept out of the
north and the few that did operate there were seen as
vehicles for converting young Muslims to
Christianity.1149
From 2009 onwards, violence spiralled across
northern and central Nigeria.1150 Boko Haram, a
militant Islamist group whose commonly used name
means ‘western education is a sin’ in Hausa,1151 sought
to impose a strict form of Sharia, or Islamic law, in the
north and end government corruption. It launched
hundreds of attacks against police officers, Christians
and Muslims whom it perceived as opponents.1152
Attacks on education between 2009 and early 2011
most often involved kidnappings of students or staff
for ransom in the oil-producing Niger Delta region,
apart from a spate of attacks on schools during an
uprising by Boko Haram in July 2009.1153 However, in
2011 and 2012, the targeting of education, particularly
schools and universities, escalated, with increasing

reports of killings by Boko Haram,and reprisals
against Islamic schools and suspected Boko Haram
supporters. Schools, universities, students and
personnel also came under attack during fighting
between Christians and Muslims.
Net enrolment in primary school was 58 per cent
(2010),1154 gross secondary enrolment was 44 per cent
(2010)1155 and gross tertiary enrolment was 10 per cent
(2005).1156 The adult literacy rate was 61 per cent
(2010).1157

Attacks on schools
During an offensive by Boko Haram militants in July
2009 in Maiduguri, Borno state, a number of schools
were targeted, although the reported number varies
greatly. According to the Sunday Trust newspaper,
which provided the only detailed report, 57 schools
were destroyed and that number was confirmed by the
chairman of the state Universal Basic Education
Board. Some of the schools were named: Lamisula
School was destroyed, and at Damgari Yerwa Primary
School, two blocks of six classrooms were burned
down. Classroom blocks at Abbaganaram Primary
School, Low Cost Primary School and Goni Damgari
Primary School were also targeted.1158 The same
newspaper reported that, a year later, only a few of the
schools had been rehabilitated and none fully, and
students were studying in temporary sheds. However,
most media sources reported only one school
destroyed in July 2009, the Goodness Mercy primary
school, also in Maiduguri, which was reduced to
rubble.1159
No attacks were reported in 2010 and only isolated
attacks were reported in 2011. In Jos, in July 2011, a
rocket was fired at a co-educational Muslim-owned
school during student examinations, though responsibility for the attack was unconfirmed. The city has a
long history of violence between Christian and Muslim
communities.1160
On 27 December 2011, in an apparent reprisal attack
following a series of church bombings by Boko Haram,
a homemade bomb was thrown into the window of an
Arabic school in Delta state while a class was in
session, wounding seven people – six of them
children under the age of nine.1161
