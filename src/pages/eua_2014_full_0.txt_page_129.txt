eGYPT
Political and sectarian tensions led to sporadic attacks
against schools, damage and looting of university
buildings, and arbitrary arrest and injury of students
on campus.675

Context
On 11 February 2011, President Hosni Mubarak was
ousted following a popular uprising, and after oneand-a-half years of military rule, Mohamed Morsi of
the Muslim Brotherhood was elected President.
However, in July 2013, the military deposed him,
leading to a violent crackdown on his supporters.
Security forces killed more than 600 pro-Morsi
protesters during the dispersal of two Cairo sit-ins on
14 August 2013.676 Sharp divisions, especially between
Islamists and secular groups, continued to result in
violent confrontations.677
Under Mubarak, there was a history of staff and
students at universities being closely monitored by
plainclothes state security on campus.678 In October
2010, an administrative court ordered security forces
off university campuses.679

Attacks on school students, teachers and education personnel
In February 2012, a court in the southern city
of Assiut sentenced Makarem Diab, a Christian school
teacher, to six years in prison on charges of defaming
Islam. 684 The case against Diab was brought by
Islamist colleagues who accused him of mocking
Islam’s prophet Mohammed.685 In September 2012,
Nevine Gad, a Christian social studies teacher at a
preparatory school in Manfalout, Assiut province, was
arrested and charged with blasphemy after a student
complained about a lesson on Islamic history she had
given, with a section on the life of Mohammed.686

Military use of schools
In November 2012, the Lycee Al-Horreya ‘Bab El Louk’
sustained heavy damage when Central Security
Forces, Egypt’s riot police, used the school to launch
attacks on protesters in Cairo over four consecutive
days. Molotov cocktails left parts of the school in
flames and soldiers threw school furniture at
protesters.687

Attacks on higher education facilities
On 6 February 2011, in an attempt to quell protests,
the Egyptian authorities closed all universities. The

During December 2011 clashes, in which the military
opened fire and protesters threw Molotov cocktails,
the Egyptian Institute, a research institution, was

accused protesters of throwing petrol bombs at the

Protests, clashes and arrests related to the wider
