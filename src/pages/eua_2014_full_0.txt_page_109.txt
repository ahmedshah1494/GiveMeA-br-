arrested had been tortured and that the publicizing of
the confessions compromised the right to a fair trial.439
In July 2012, UNAMA reported 17 alleged poisonings,
particularly targeting girls’ schools. In all cases it
reviewed, however, it found no evidence of ‘deliberate
acts to harm’. Testing of contaminated water by the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the
World Health Organization (WHO) and government
departments found no evidence of toxic substances,
and forensic testing of other potential sources of
poison proved inconclusive.440 Preliminary WHO
investigations of some cases pointed to mass hysteria
as the likely cause.441

Military use of schools
Schools were also used for military purposes. The UN
Secretary-General reported that international military
forces used schools on five occasions in 2010,442 and
that in 2011 schools were taken over 20 times by
armed groups and 11 times by pro-government forces,
totalling 31 incidents of military use of schools.443 In
2012, 10 schools were used for military purposes,
three of them by anti-government elements and seven
by pro-government forces.444
Although most occupations were temporary, local
elders in Kapisa province told UNAMA in 2012 that the
Afghan National Army (ANA) had used a school
building for the previous four years, forcing staff to
teach pupils outside.
There was also evidence that occupation of schools by
security forces made the buildings a target for attack.
For instance, in May 2012, after police occupied two
schools in Badakhshan province, displacing the
students and teachers, anti-government elements
fired a rocket-propelled grenade into the school
compound, damaging the building, and warned local
officials that they would continue to target schools
used for military purposes. In June, the forces vacated
both schools.445

Attacks on higher education
Several universities were also targeted. For example, a
new Islamic university, Jamiyat’al-Uloom’al-Islamiya,
in Jalalabad, was badly damaged in a bomb attack on
8 February 2011, following threatening letters
accusing the university and three local seminaries of
