Bandits were robbing schools, stealing food off children and money from their parents. Landmines laid on roads approaching schools were blocking access to some schools. Teachers have reported being arbitrarily detained by the military and rebels for up to three months at a time.588NigeriaBoko Haram (“Western Education is Forbidden”), an Islamic group opposed to Western education, launched attacks across four northern provinces on 26 July 2009, which led to 154 deaths. They raided police stations and neighbourhoods and destroyed government buildings, including Goodness Mercy School, Maiduguri, which was reduced to rubble.589 Boko Haram leader Ustaz Mohammed Yusuf, who was later killed by security forces, said: “Democracy and the current system of education must be changed, otherwise this war that is yet to start would continue for long”.590 Another senior member of the rebel group, Abdulmuni Ibrahim Mohammed, who was arrested in Kano State, said: “We do not believe in Western education. It corrupts our ideas and beliefs. That is why we are standing up to defend our religion”.591
