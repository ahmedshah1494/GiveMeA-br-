report violations of the ceasefire agreement between
the MILF and the government, including attacks on
schools.267 The Bantay Ceasefire group has shared
information and reports of child rights violations with
the UN MRM in place in the Philippines since 2007.
Awareness-raising
In addition, the MPC runs the Youth Volunteers for
Peace Action Network. They seek to generate support
for the peace process among youth through advocacy
campaigns.268 UN agencies and NGOs also engage
communities in a process of awareness-raising on
existing legislation.

National and international support for community action
These community actions and the LIZOP process build
upon, and are underpinned by, government legislation
to protect education. Key legislation supports
education for all, prohibits the military use of schools
and promotes protection of children in conflict.269

Reported outcomes
The village of Tina, in the province of Maguindanao in
Mindanao, has shown positive results of community
and agency efforts. As of 2008, conflict forced the

community started to return, UNICEF began working
with the community and other key stakeholders to
implement the LIZOP model enabling Tina Primary
School to reopen with 104 pupils in 2011. Members of
the armed forces and the MILF all decided that they
would not carry firearms in the vicinity of the school
and other learning spaces and agreed not to allow
their own children to carry firearms at school.270
The Bantay Ceasefire group is also perceived to have
made parties to conflict more cautious because they
know a civilian-led monitoring team is reporting on
their actions.271

Key lessons learned
Although external actors are initiating and rolling out
LIZOP, the model borrows heavily from the two
decades-old Philippine practice of establishing
community-wide zones of peace.272 Research on zones
of peace initiatives has found that the process of
establishing community-wide peace agreements was
