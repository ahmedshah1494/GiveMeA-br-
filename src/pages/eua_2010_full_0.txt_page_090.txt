If attacks are content driven, limits will be placed on the knowledge that can be researched, taught or applied, for example in the political sphere.212This raises questions about the purpose of education. Illegitimate governments that only maintain their position through the exertion of power will frequently articulate that the purpose is to maintain the status quo, to have people develop the skills necessary to maintain the existing structure without threatening it. “That ends up being a very narrow vision of what education is for, both for society and the individual,” Quinn says. “If you are of the mind that education is a process of personal fulfilment, extension and liberation, allowing the person to contribute to their full capacity in society, then you see that these restrictions have a much wider impact, that they are really a way to enforce an alternative world vision in which it is acceptable to structure things through brute force”.213Attacks at the higher education level can have serious long-term social, economic and political consequences for the countries where they are most severe, as well as for neighbouring countries because there is a loss of knowledge, a loss of opportunities for collaboration internally and internationally, and a degradation of respect for universities.It is for this reason that the perceived dividing line between what is termed a political attack and what is an attack on higher education may be a false one, because it assumes that a university has no public role, no public voice, and that there are areas that should be off limits to educational research and its use. “The university does have a place and should be engaged in society, to justify society’s investment in it,” Quinn says. What is the point of academics researching politics, Quinn asks, if they cannot use that knowledge to develop politics?
