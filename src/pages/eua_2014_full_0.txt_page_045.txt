Recruitment of children and sexual
violence at schools or along school routes
Recruitment of children for military purposes and
sexual violence are addressed in this study only
insofar as they amount to a type of attack on schools
and students. While forced recruitment and sexual
violence happen in a range of settings during conflict,
parties may specifically target schools or school
routes because they are places where children are
known to be concentrated. Although child recruitment
and sexual violence are regularly reported by the UN,
there is very little reporting on how many of these
violations take place at school or along school routes.
This study found evidence of recruitment of children
from school, or en route to or from school, during the
2009-2012 period in at least six countries: Colombia,
DRC, Pakistan, Somalia, Thailand and Yemen. In
Colombia, guerrilla and paramilitary groups were
reported to recruit children at schools;83 child recruits
were used as spies or to transport arms or pass on
messages to other students in schools, as well as to
run their drug business inside schools.84 In Pakistan,
children were recruited from madrassas (religious
schools) and mainstream schools. In some cases,
they were lured or abducted from schools and
madrassas to train to become suicide bombers.85
Recruitment methods varied across countries and
ranged from selection through indoctrination
programmes at school and the offering of inducements, to abduction en route, the use of death threats
and the rounding up of whole groups of students at
schools.
For example, in Colombia, armed groups waited
outside schools to talk to children, find out information, and recruit and control them.86 In Yemen,
Houthi rebels used students and teachers to recruit
children at schools for them.87 In DRC, a breakaway
rebel group seized 32 boys from a school, tied them up
and marched them off to a military camp to train to
fight.88
In Somalia, where thousands of children were given
military training or recruited, mostly from schools,
teachers were ordered by the armed group Al-Shabaab
to enlist them or release them for training.89 One
