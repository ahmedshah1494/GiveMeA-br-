Conclusions and recommendations Graça Machel, in her groundbreaking 1996 report to the UN Secretary-General on the situation of children in armed conflict, argued that the destruction of educational infrastructure represents one of the greatest development setbacks for countries affected by conflict. “Years of lost schooling and vocational skills will take equivalent years to replace and their absence imposes a greater vulnerability on the ability of societies to recover after war,” she said.319Education under Attack (2007) examined the targeting of education for attack in the ten years following her report and found that there had been a dramatic increase in the number of recorded incidents from 2004 onwards. This study, Education under Attack 2010, has found reported evidence that the systematic targeting of students, teachers, academics, education staff and institutions has continued in a greater number of countries during the period from January 2007 to July 2009. The dramatic intensification of attacks reported in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Thailand and the sudden explosion of attacks during military operations in Georgia and Gaza have been the most worrying new trends. Failure to eradicate the problem in Colombia, Nepal and Iraq and the scale of ongoing attacks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and Zimbabwe are matters of grave concern. An often overlooked but significant worry is the number of countries where universities and their students and academics have been targeted, such as Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Iran and Zimbabwe.
