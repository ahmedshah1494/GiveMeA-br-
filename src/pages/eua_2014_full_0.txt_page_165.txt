
border in Afghanistan. There was no independent
corroboration of the Army’s claims.1256 In August 2013,
The Guardian published evidence that children in
Afghanistan were being sent to madrassas in Pakistan
to be trained as suicide bombers.1257

Military use of schools
According to media reports, there were at least 40
cases of schools being used by the military,1258 five
incidents of militants based in schools1259 and one
case of the police being billeted right next to a school
in 2009-2012.1260 For example, one media report
indicated that schools in Swat district had been used
as bases by the Pakistani military for over a year,
preventing the education of around 10,000
students.1261 In another case, the Pakistani military
showed journalists a school that had been used by
militants in Sararogha as a courthouse and a base.1262
At another boarding school in Ladha, the army
claimed that it had been used to train suicide bombers
and store military hardware, including explosives,
ammunition, weapons and bomb-making chemicals,
and that texts related to combat remained. It was not
possible to verify the army’s claims.1263

Attacks on higher education
Lahore and Karachi were the worst affected cities for
regular clashes between armed political student
groups on university campuses, a spillover of the
political, ethnic and sectarian violence in these cities.
Students and teachers were also affected by Karachi’s
communal violence and a trend of kidnapping for
ransom.
Higher education staff and students were victims of
regular violence and intimidation by student political
groups on campuses, many of whom carried firearms
openly, particularly in Lahore and Karachi. In addition
to dozens of injuries, the US State Department
observed that these groups used threats of physical
violence to influence the studies and lifestyles of
students and teachers, including the course content,
examination procedures, grades, the financial and
recruitment decisions of university administrations,
the language students spoke and the clothes they
wore.1264

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

Seven students were injured in the early hours of 26
June 2011 when about 25 members of the Islami Jamiat
Talba (IJT) student organization at Punjab University
attacked philosophy students with sticks, bike chains
and bricks as they slept in their halls. There were
reports of the sound of gunfire and some students
brandished pistols but did not shoot anyone. One
student was thrown from a first floor window. The IJT
had accused the philosophy department of vulgarity
and un-Islamic behaviour.1265
In addition, higher education students and staff were
attacked by those opposed to female education or
were victims of kidnappings for ransom, which often
also affected the drivers of those attacked. As with
school attacks, some simply targeted universities
because they associated them with authority. The
Taliban said that they were responsible for launching a
double suicide bombing on the International Islamic
University in Islamabad on 20 October 2009, which
killed two female and three male students, in retaliation for a Pakistani army offensive in South
Waziristan.1266
In Balochistan, there was a clear pattern of targeted
killings of academics or students of non-Baloch
ethnicity or opponents of Baloch nationalism, with
gunmen on motorbikes launching attacks in daylight
in public, usually when the victim was en route to or
from university. The BLA claimed responsibility for the
murder on 5 November 2009 of Kurshid Akhtar Ansari,
the head of library sciences at the University of
Balochistan1267 and for the murder on 27 April 2010 of
Nazima Talib, a professor at the same institution.1268
Students and academics linked with nationalist organizations disappeared in a number of cases. For
example, Amnesty International reported that a
student and member of the Baloch Students
Organisation (Azad) allegedly disappeared from his
hometown of Panjgur, Balochistan, on 21 January
2011.1269 In another incident, on 4 July 2011, a Baloch
Students Organisation (Azad) activist was abducted
from Hub town, Lasbela district, Balochistan. His
corpse was found on 6 July with three bullet wounds to
the upper body.1270
In Karachi, students were affected by outbreaks of citywide political and sectarian violence. On 26 December

2010, a bomb on the Karachi University campus
targeted praying students of the Imamia Students
Organisation, injuring five. It led to protests
demanding that the administration prevent sectarian
fighting on campus, claiming that bombs and
weapons were being brought in.1271 Shot by unidentified assailants on a motorbike while they were
talking at a tea stall outside their seminary in
November 2012, six students were among 20 people
killed during sectarian violence in one day.1272 An
academic was killed in Karachi: Maulana Muhammad
Ameen, a teacher at Jamia Binoria Alamia University
and a distinguished Sunni cleric, was gunned down by
assassins on motorbikes in October 2010.1273
Also in October 2010, Taliban assassins shot dead Dr
Mohammad Farooq Khan, in Mardan, KhyberPakhtunkhwa province. Khan was the vice-chancellor
of a new liberal university in Swat, due to be inaugurated a few days later, and had also devoted his time
to teaching 150 boys liberated from the Taliban by the
Pakistan Army at a school set up by the military in Swat
with support from international donors.1274 According
to the New York Times, he was one of six university
professors and Muslim intellectuals to have been
murdered in the previous 12 months.1275

Attacks on education in 2013
Students from kindergarten, schools and colleges,
teachers of both sexes and education institutions
across the country were attacked in Pakistan in 2013.
There were continuing attacks on schools, including
bombings,1276 grenade attacks1277 and shootings.
Female education and schooling in the north-west and
tribal areas bordering Afghanistan continued to be
targeted prominently.1278 For instance, in January,
militants shot dead five female teachers and two
health workers returning by bus from their community
project near Swabi, in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa
province.1279 In November, militants abducted 11
teachers from Hira Public School in the Khyber tribal
agency after they helped in a polio vaccination
campaign for schoolchildren.1280
There were also attacks on schools in the south-west,
in Karachi, where the Taliban has increased its
influence,1281 and in Balochistan.1282 One primary
school in western Karachi was attacked with guns,
