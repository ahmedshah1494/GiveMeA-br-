
most successful and sustainable when engaging a
range of stakeholders – including government, local
and international organizations, church groups273 and
the community.274 Community engagement in
monitoring compliance with peace agreements
enabled permanent surveillance with low resource
investment. Further, it proved helpful to engage with
parties to the conflict as parents, rather than as armed
individuals. Overall, it may be seen that, out of the
four approaches outlined in the typology of
community engagement, only ‘communityinvolvement’ appears absent or insignificant in the
Philippines context.

Afghanistan: Negotiation and adaptation
Education was a point of contention in Afghanistan’s
conflicts long before the Taliban.275 Since the change
of government in 2001, schools have experienced
violent attacks,276 including arson, explosions and
grenades, as well as threats to teachers and the killing
and injury of students, teachers and other education
personnel. While the common depiction in the media
was that a majority of incidents emanated from
Taliban opposition to girls’ education, the reasons
were more complex. These additionally included
schools’ symbolic value as government entities, their
association with international military forces,
ideological opposition to any education offered
outside of madrassas (Islamic schools), local disputes
or ethnic rivalries, and opposition to the central
government and the rule of law by criminal groups.277

Initiatives engaging community groups in protection
of education
Communities in Afghanistan help manage and protect
schools278 through negotiation, physical strengthening, guards and adaptation of education delivery.
Some examples of community action are outlined
below.
School management committees, school protection
committees, school security shuras and community
protection shuras – defence groups focused either on
schools or the community as a whole – and parent
teacher associations were established, covering over
8,000 schools by 2009279 with support from NGOs, UN
agencies and the MoE. While the arrangements are

different, a common thread is participation of
community members to support education. To protect
education, these groups may: involve religious
leaders in reviewing or modifying school curricula;
improve governance; or establish lines of communication with potential attackers for purposes of
negotiation.
Government, NGOs and UN agencies have supported
and rolled out schools located inside communities.280
This may reduce the likelihood of attacks on children,
teachers or physical spaces by reducing distance to
school, attracting less attention and making it harder
for intruders to approach unnoticed. The schools also
tend to have stronger ties with their respective
communities which, in turn, work harder to protect
them.281
Communities also provide night guards for their
schools to prevent attack. School guards or whole
communities have put out fires caused by arson
attacks, reducing damage and enabling education
activities to resume more quickly.

National and international support for community action
Local-level community successes in negotiation must
be assessed against a backdrop of national-level
action. Attacks on students, teachers and school
buildings are criminal offences under Afghan law.282
The Ministry of Education has sought to prevent
attacks and reopen schools closed due to conflict,
including through negotiation with local-level Taliban
leaders on ways to adapt education to make it more
acceptable to all parties. In March 2009, following
these government initiatives, 161 schools re-opened
compared to 35 in 2007-2008.283 Between late 2010
and early 2011, negotiations between the Ministry of
Education and top-level Taliban leaders started, while
local-level negotiations also accelerated.284 The
number of schools re-opening grew while the number
of attacks dropped substantially in the second half of
2010 and even more so in 2011285 However, the
following year, the discussions stalled and the trend of
re-opening schools was partially reversed, even
though the Ministry of Education continued to report
overall progress in terms of decreasing violence and
increased re-opening of schools.286

Similarly, the success of adapting education delivery
at a local level must in part be attributed to central
ministry-level support and the resourcing and
promotion of this approach by international NGOs
such as Save the Children, CARE and Catholic Relief
Services.287

Reported outcomes
A number of successful site-specific processes of
negotiation between the Taliban and education
committees or village elders have led to the release of
teachers and the re-opening of schools.288 In some
cases, local communities agreed to adaptation, such
as curriculum changes or the hiring of Talibanapproved religious teachers.289 A randomized
controlled trial study of community schools in Ghor
province found that these schools have increased
access, completion rates and learning outcomes and
addressed gender constraints.290
However, according to field research by CARE in 2009,
only 4 per cent of respondents indicated that attacks
had been prevented in the past. Although this figure is
very low, communities believe their involvement in
prevention and response is important.291 The lack of
statistical proof of impact of community efforts may
reflect the difficulty of measuring prevention
(compared with response actions) and the challenges
in monitoring and reporting attacks in general, rather
than indicate that community engagement has limited
outcomes.

Key lessons learned
The majority of communities that CARE was able to
survey in its 2009 study felt that responsibility for
decision-making and implementation of mechanisms
to protect education from attack must remain local.292
Respondents believed that communities may play
numerous roles based on the type of attack and perpetrators responsible. For example, respondents
reported that, when attacks were linked to armed
conflict as opposed to criminal activity, the community
was more likely to know the attackers or be better able
to open a line of communication with them.293 Popular
opinion also appeared to play a role. An Afghanistan
Analysts Network report suggests that the Taliban
were aware of the need to interact positively with local
