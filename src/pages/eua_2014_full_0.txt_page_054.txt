
use of schools can facilitate advocacy with the
relevant military authorities to end such use. Accurate
reports of damage and destruction of schools inform
rehabilitation and safety measures. Monitoring and
reporting also play a vital role in accountability.
These objectives may require different types of
monitoring, while channels for reporting will also vary,
depending on the objective. Several mechanisms and
processes provide regular channels for monitoring
and reporting.
UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism on Grave
Violations against Children in Situations of Armed
Conflict
The UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM)
on Grave Violations against Children in Situations of
Armed Conflict was established in 2005 through
Security Council Resolution 1612 to end six grave violations:
• Recruitment or use of children by armed forces
or armed groups
• Killing or maiming of children
• Rape and other grave sexual violence against
children
• Attacks against schools and hospitals
• Denial of humanitarian access to children
• Abduction of children
Each year, the UN Secretary-General produces a report
to the UN Security Council on children and armed
conflict that includes in its annexes a list naming
parties to conflict who have committed one or more of
the four ‘trigger’ violations.126 One of the most significant developments during the reporting period was
the passing of UN Security Council Resolution 1998 in
July 2011, which made attacks on schools and
hospitals one of those trigger violations.127 In 2012 and
2013, the Taliban forces in Afghanistan (including the
Tora Bora Front, the Jamat Sunat al-Dawa Salafia and
the Latif Mansur Network), Forces démocratiques de
libération du Rwanda (FDLR) in DRC, Islamic State of
Iraq/Al-Qaida in Iraq, and the Syrian Armed Forces,
intelligence forces and the Shabbiha militia in Syria
were listed as parties that attacked schools and
hospitals.128

A working group of the UN Security Council has a
number of means to urge the listed party to change its
behaviour to stop grave violations against children,
including submissions to Security Council sanctions
committees, referral to the International Criminal
Court and field visits.129 To be delisted, the UN must
verify that the party has ended the grave violation. This
is most often achieved through the party implementing an action plan agreed with the UN to end,
address and prevent the grave violation.
The first time that a party to the conflict is listed in a
specific country, this should lead to the MRM being
established to provide timely, reliable and objective
information on the six grave violations.130 The MRM in
any given country is managed by the Country Task
Force co-chaired by the UNICEF Representative and the
UN Resident Coordinator in countries without a UN
Mission, and by the UNICEF Representative and the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General in
peacekeeping or special political mission settings
where there is a Department of Political Affairs or
Department for Peacekeeping Operations Mission.
The findings of the Country Task Forces are reported to
the UN Secretary-General and distributed via the
Secretary-General’s annual report on children and
armed conflict, through the Secretary-General’s
country-specific reports on children and armed
conflict, and through a quarterly internal Global
Horizontal Note that provides regular updates on the
situation in all MRM countries.131 Information collected
by the Country Task Forces is also used to develop
appropriate responses to the violations.
While the MRM covers an important niche for
monitoring and reporting, it is specifically established
to monitor the situation for schools and does not
include attacks on higher education. Also, it is limited
to situations of armed conflict, and is not tasked with
reporting on the overall impact of attacks on children’s
access to education or on the prevention and
response measures taken to protect the education
system, personnel and students.132 The MRM only
covers reported incidents that it has been able to
verify and therefore may miss cases where monitors
lack access or where they cannot otherwise secure
accurate information. The information the MRM

presents, therefore, will always be about patterns of
attacks but will not always give the complete number
of attacks.
For the reasons given above, so far the MRM has
operated in a limited number of countries – typically
around 13-14 in any given year. It did operate in many
of the countries that were very heavily or heavily
affected by attacks on education in 2009-2012, but it
did not operate in all of them, or in a number of other
profiled countries in which a significant pattern of
attacks on education took place.
In the majority of countries affected by attacks on
education, there remains a need to further strengthen
monitoring and reporting partnerships between UN
agencies, international NGOs, human rights and
development NGOs, and education ministries and
district education offices to improve data collection
and verification of data, and better inform the range of
responses.
There are a number of examples of strong collaboration to draw from.
The Education Cluster
Education clusters,133 which are present in all major
humanitarian emergencies and many post-crisis
settings, including in 19 of the countries profiled in
this study, can play a positive role in assessing the
impact of attacks on education, as well as in
monitoring attacks and military use and sharing information to stop them from occurring. Education cluster
coordinators and information officers have been
instrumental in several countries in developing tools
for data collection, and they have been collating,
analysing and using information on attacks on
schools and their impact, for example, to assess the
financial costs and programming needs for appropriate response and to advocate with key partners. In
Côte d’Ivoire, the Education Cluster, with the full
cooperation of the Ministry of Education, was the
catalyst for a nationwide survey on the impact of the
post-election conflict on schools in 2010-2011, which
involved head teachers in collecting data for the
survey.134 In South Sudan, the Cluster developed and
disseminated briefing notes on military use of schools
and collected data that were useful in negotiations
with armed forces to vacate schools. The success of
