In September 1986, the first Zone of Peace, Freedom, and Neutrality (ZOPFAN)
in the Philippines was declared in Naga City in southern Luzon. This was a
community-based and people-initiated peace effort, involving the council of
elders and the church. Since then, this model has gained ground around the
country. For more details, see: Pushpa Iyer, Peace Zones of Mindanao,
Philippines: Civil Society Efforts to End Violence (Massachusetts: Collaborative
Learning Projects, October 2004); Mario Cabrera, “Schools as ‘Zones of Peace’,”
UNICEF Philippines; Tilman Wörtz Zeitenspiegel, The Philippines: Peace Zones in
a War Region (Tuebingen, Germany: Institute for Peace Education); and Debbie

Church groups involved were of various denominations depending on the
community. In communities where more than one religious or church group is
present, the full range of religious groups would ideally be involved in the
process.

Some examples include: In Herat in western Afghanistan, police collaborated
with the community after an attack to arrange meetings to negotiate an end to
attacks and the reopening of schools. Global Education Cluster, Protecting
Education in Countries Affected by Conflict Booklet 3: Community-based
Protection and Prevention (Global Education Cluster, October 2012), 8. In 2010, it
was reported that a school in Jowzjan reopened after local communities put pressure on the Taliban. Elsewhere, the Taliban closed schools for two months as the
government wanted to use them as election stations. The local elders convinced
the government not to conduct election polling in schools and the Taliban to
permit the schools to function. Antonio Giustozzi and Claudio Franco, The Battle

Results from CARE’s research showed that 85% of key informants felt protection of schools is the community’s responsibility. See Marit Glad, Knowledge on

schools were 34.4% higher and girls’ enrolment was 51.1% higher. The performance gap between girls and boys was reduced by a third. Dana Burde and Leigh

The concept of community schools has been taken to scale by national and
international agencies. Community schools are now estimated to reach 156,000
students, according to data given in Morten Sigsgaard, Education and Fragility in
Afghanistan: A Situational Analysis (Paris: UNESCO International Institute for
Educational Planning, 2009), 19. This information illustrates the scope for variation in the level at which communities engage in one specific form of programmatic action. Some villages have initiated community schools themselves, others
have been involved primarily in their implementation.
