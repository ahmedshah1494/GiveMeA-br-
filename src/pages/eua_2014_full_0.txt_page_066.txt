
Pressure for greater accountability in higher education
has stemmed primarily from political and human
rights campaigns at local and international levels,
rather than the use of legal instruments, the prosecution of perpetrators or enhanced monitoring and
reporting. Examples include student protests and
demonstrations against repressive measures or the
allegedly excessive use of force by state security
forces; and national and international advocacy
campaigns in support of individual academics or
students. There is no clear evidence regarding the
impact of many such actions.
GCPEA’s research examining the relationship between
autonomy and security concluded that enhancing
university autonomy vis-à-vis the state may in some
situations contribute to reducing or preventing attacks
on higher education, particularly when coupled with
university-controlled internal security provision.217 This
includes developing and extending the notion of the
university as a space outside of direct state control
(even when funding is largely state-provided) – particularly concerning decisions about recruitment,
financial and administrative management, curriculum
and research. It also includes prohibiting state forces
from entering university campuses (unless invited in
by the institutional leadership or in extremely rare
circumstances).218 While university autonomy alone is
insufficient to prevent attacks, many of which occur
outside of university campuses, the research found
that it appears to be an important component of
efforts to improve the protection of higher education.
These issues are explored in greater detail in this
study in the essay: ‘Protecting higher education’.

Advocacy
Advocacy has been undertaken at international,
national and local levels over the past several years to
increase awareness of the problem of attacks and
catalyse improved response and prevention.
Concerted advocacy undertaken by a number of NGOs
and UN agencies seems to have encouraged the
decision to include attacks on schools and hospitals
as a triggering offence for mandated UN monitoring
and reporting of violations against children in armed
conflict through UN Security Council Resolution 1998

EDUCATION UNDER ATTACK 2014

(2011) and a corresponding increase in reporting in
the UN Secretary-General’s annual report on children
and armed conflict. Awareness-raising efforts have
also contributed to improved coverage of attacks in
these reports.

cations and statements calling for an end to attacks
and for appropriate redress. Collectively, these organizations have raised awareness and put pressure on
perpetrators, including through the use of petitions,
open letters and submissions to human rights bodies.

Advocacy efforts around the right to education in
crisis-affected contexts have also called greater
attention to the issue of attacks. In September 2012,
the UN Secretary-General launched his ‘Global
Education First Initiative’, a five-year strategy to
improve education access and quality worldwide,
which included as its second ‘Key action’: ‘Sustain
education in humanitarian crises, especially in
conflict’.219 To help implement this component of the
agenda, the education-in-emergencies community
met to develop ‘Education Cannot Wait’, which was
launched at an event in September 2012 at the UN
General Assembly bringing together global leaders
from governments, international organizations and
civil society. These leaders endorsed a ‘Call to
Action’220 urging the protection of schools from
attacks, as well as significant increases in humanitarian aid for education and integration of emergency
prevention, preparedness, response and recovery in
education sector plans and budgets.221 An INEE
Education Cannot Wait Advocacy Working Group,
focused on reaching the goals set out in the Call to
Action, was formed and a high-level follow-up event
was held in September 2013 to assess progress and
shortfalls and reaffirm commitments to: ‘plan, prioritize and protect education in crisis-affected
contexts’.222

Education Clusters at country level have used data
collected by education and child protection partners
to advocate with government counterparts to vacate
schools as well as to mobilize funds for the rehabilitation or construction of damaged schools and the
provision of educational materials such as desks and
textbooks. For example, in Côte d’Ivoire, monitoring
information was used for advocacy with the ministries
of education and defence on the issue of attacks on
education; it was also published in the Education
Cluster’s reports.223 Education and child protection
partners undertook awareness-raising activities to
sensitize armed groups to the effects of military use of
schools and to improve their understanding of international humanitarian law, including through training
and visits to military checkpoints and occupied
schools. As a result of these efforts, military
commanders dismantled checkpoints near schools
and armed groups vacated the majority of occupied
schools.224

International human rights organizations such as
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International and
trade union organizations such as Education
International have helped to focus public attention on
the problem of attacks, producing country reports that
cover the issue in-depth in a range of contexts, or
alerts on the plight of students, teachers and
academics who have been arbitrarily imprisoned,
tortured or killed. Other international NGOs such as
CARE, Save the Children and Watchlist on Children and
Armed Conflict have similarly developed thematic
reports and advocacy documents highlighting the
problem. Local human rights groups have also
continued their coverage of attacks, producing publi-

Advocacy has also been undertaken by organizations
or communities directly with governments, armed
forces or armed groups. According to a UN
respondent, advocacy and awareness-raising with the
armed forces in South Sudan increased their understanding of the negative impacts of military use of
schools on education and children’s well-being.225
Subsequently, the number of schools occupied
decreased significantly, as did the length of time from
when a school was reported to be occupied until it was
vacated.226 Then in 2013, the SPLA ordered its troops
to stop using schools.227
