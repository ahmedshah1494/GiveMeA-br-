Catholic School in Bekasi in May 2010, was reportedly
in retaliation for perceived ‘blasphemous’ comments
on a blog.791 On 8 February 2011, a Catholic school
complex was destroyed in Temanggung by an angry
mob. Police believed the attack was the result of
rumours spread by text messages that the defendant
in a religious blasphemy case would be given a light
sentence.792 In January 2012, three Catholic schools in
Yogyakarta, Central Java, were attacked, one by a
group of 25 militant Muslims. An investigation found
that the motive was an alleged anti-Islamic posting on
Facebook, but that it had been posted by someone
falsely claiming to be a student at one of the
schools.793

Attacks on school students, teachers and other
education personnel
Two people were killed and at least six were injured in
a Sunni attack on a group of students and teachers
from a Shia boarding school in Bangil, East Java, as
they returned to school via minibus after visiting their
families in Sampang, East Java, on 26 August 2012.
Around 500 machete-wielding men were involved in
the attack.794 Later that year, Sunni militants attacked
a Sufi learning house in Jambo village, Bireuen
regency, Aceh, and killed Teungku Aiyub, the leader of
the house, allegedly because he was a heretic. A
student-cum-assistant also died in the attack.795

Military use of schools
A police raid in November 2012 on Darul Akhfiya
School in Nganjuk, East Java, found rifles, ammunition
and a cleaver. Police said they suspected the school
was training Islamist militants.796
