and nine months in jail. In September 2013, he was
released pending an appeal.1679

Attacks on education in 2013
A bomb exploded at a school in Cizre in January
injuring three students, but the perpetrator was
unknown.1680
In September and October, police used rubber bullets,
tear gas and water cannon against Middle East
Technical University students protesting against a
road planned through their campus.1681
The acquittal of sociologist Pinar Selek on terrorism
charges was overturned in 2013 and she was given a
life sentence. An advocate for the rights of socially
disadvantaged children and women who has
researched Kurdish groups, she had been repeatedly
arrested and tried on allegations of participating in a
1998 explosion at a spice market. Court investigations
found that the explosion resulted from an accidental
gas leak rather than a bomb and, in the 14 years
following the incident, Selek was acquitted three
times of terrorism charges due to lack of admissible
evidence.1682 She was also allegedly tortured to elicit
the names of her interview participants in contravention of the ethics rules governing research, and in
contravention of domestic and international law.1683

There was widespread destruction of schools in direct
attacks, including air strikes, bombing, shelling and
looting, as well as in general fighting and in clashes
during protests. Schools and universities were used as
barracks, bases and firing positions.1684

Context
A political crisis in 2009 between the ruling General
People’s Congress party and the main opposition
bloc, the Joint Meeting Parties, led to the
postponement of parliamentary elections.1685 In 2009,
the country witnessed fighting break out again
between the army and rebels from the Houthi
community in the far north, as well as escalating
protests by supporters of independence or greater
autonomy for southern Yemen, and the emergence of

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), an affiliate
of the global terrorism network, Al-Qaeda.1686
Inspired by the Arab Spring, student groups took a
prominent role in the uprising from February 2011,1687
peacefully occupying ‘Change Square’ in front of
Sana’a University, which became a focal point for
protesters.1688 Following a military crackdown on
civilian protests, pro- and anti-government forces
fought each other sporadically in 2011.1689 AQAP
militants, meanwhile, took over key areas of the
south. However, a US-backed offensive in April and
May 2012 drove the militants out of their strongholds
in Zinjibar and Jaar city, Abyan governorate, and the
Azzan area in Shabwa governorate.1690 Meanwhile, a
comprehensive set of agreements, including the Gulf
Cooperation Council’s Initiative and the Agreement on
the Implementation Mechanism for the Transition,
was brokered after ten months of protest, ushering in
a two-year period of political transition.1691
Attacks on schools and other education-related
incidents involving violence and the use of force were
a significant concern and sometimes a growing trend
during 2009-2012, affecting schools in different parts
of Yemen at different times. Between 2009 and 2012,
there were at least 720 incidents affecting schools,
including direct attacks, looting, threats and military
use of schools, according to the UN SecretaryGeneral’s annual reports on children and armed
conflict.1692 Additionally, data supplied by a UN
respondent for 2011 and 2012 suggest that there could
have been as many as 853 incidents in total in 20092012.1693 It is not known how many of them were
targeted attacks.1694
In education, gross enrolment was 97 per cent at
primary level, 46 per cent at secondary level and 10
per cent at tertiary level (2011).1695 Adult literacy was
65 per cent (2011).1696

Attacks on schools
From August 2009 to February 2010, attacks on and
damage to schools increased in the far north during
the war between the army and Houthi rebels in Sa’ada
governorate on the border with Saudi Arabia. The
Director of the Education Office in Sa’ada, Muhammad
Abdul Rahim Al-Shamiri, reported that out of the

governorate’s 725 schools, all of which were closed
during the war, 70 were almost completely
destroyed1697 and another 145 were partially destroyed
or looted.1698 Ahmed Al-Qurashi, director of the NGO
Seyaj Organization for Childhood Protection,
confirmed that schools in the Sa’ada governorate were
targeted during this period, as were other places used
to teach children while schools were closed, such as
tents, mosques and houses.1699
According to the UN, by the end of 2010, some 311
schools in Sa’ada had been partially or completely
destroyed because of shelling and crossfire during
clashes between the parties to the conflict, but again
it was not specified how many had been targeted.1700
In two separate incidents, unexploded ordnance was
sighted in schools in Malaheed in Sa’ada governorate.
Away from the conflict in Sa’ada, three bombs were
found in a girls’ school in Aden Governorate in the far
south.1701
During 2011, there was a spike in school attacks and
school-related incidents away from the Houthi conflict
area, following a general increase in unrest after the
protests demanding reforms. According to the UN,
attacks included looting, shelling, aerial
bombardment, arson and intimidation.1702 According
to Seyaj Organization for Childhood Protection, whose
staff visited dozens of schools immediately after they
had been attacked in 2011, incidents also included
IEDs planted in schools, detonators attached to
school doors and rocket damage.1703 They also saw
nine schools in Abyan that had been hit in airstrikes by
Yemeni forces after militants linked to Al-Qaeda used
them for military purposes.1704 The UN reported 211
incidents affecting 150 schools that year. The Sana’a
region was particularly affected with at least 130
incidents affecting 77 schools, and there were 72
incidents in Tai’zz in the southern highlands.1705 On 19
October 2011, a school in Ta’izz was seriously
damaged by pro-government armed men, who tried to
burn it down. At least seven students who protested
against the entry of the armed elements into the
school were injured.1706
