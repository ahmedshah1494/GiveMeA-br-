Attacks on higher education
The director of the National Counter-terrorism Agency
claimed in November 2010 that there had been an
increase in religious extremism among university
students and that a growing number of individuals
engaged in terrorist activity were being indoctrinated
on college campuses. A study by Islamic scholar Zulfi
Mubarak from Malang Islamic State University said
recruiters targeted science and engineering students
to make explosive devices.797
In August 2012, one student was reportedly killed
during a raid by police, army and counter-terrorism
personnel on Cenderawasih University, Abepura. A
further 11 students were reportedly held by police and
some were tortured. One possible reason for the
attack was that the students came from the same
tribal group as many members of the non-violent
campaigning group, the West Papua National
Committee.798

Attacks on education in 2013
Isolated incidents continued in 2013. According to a
Human Rights Watch researcher, in March a Sunni
mob destroyed the gates of the Al-Mujahadah
Foundation, a Sufi madrassa in southern Aceh, while
police reportedly stood by; in July, a dormitory of the
same school was burned down and a month later its
compound wall was reportedly destroyed.799 The gates
were destroyed on the same day that the South Aceh
regency government ordered students to leave the
facility in response to a ruling by Aceh’s Ulama
Consultative Council that its teachings were ‘false’.800
On 6 August, a petrol bomb was thrown at a Catholic
high school in Jakarta, an act that may have been
timed to coincide with the end of Ramadan.801
