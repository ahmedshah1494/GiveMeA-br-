from different sources unless the same unique
identities are assigned to the same schools where
attacks have occurred or the same spelling is used.
To date, rigorous research – whether quantitative or
qualitative – into the impact of attacks, particularly
the long-term impact, is lacking. So, too, are in-depth
evaluations studying the outcomes of measures taken
by governments, NGOs and communities aimed at
preventing or responding to attacks. As a result, for
the sections on the impact of attacks and responses to
attacks, the study has had to rely primarily on case
study evidence and reports of measures undertaken
and challenges faced.
Finally, due to time and resource constraints, fieldbased country research, particularly into the impacts
of attacks and the outcomes of prevention and
response measures at local and national levels, was
extremely limited. For this study, it was not possible to
undertake in-depth discussions with students,
teachers and other education personnel, and the
families and communities of which they are a part.
Consequently, these important voices are often
missing from the analysis. However, interviews with
country-level informants, including ministry staff in a
small number of cases, human rights researchers, and
NGO and UN programme staff, as well as data
provided in response to requests for information and a
thorough review of existing literature, have helped to
provide a more complete picture.
