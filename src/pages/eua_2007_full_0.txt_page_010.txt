Other weapons such as knives and hammers are also used.c) Destruction of education buildings and resources via remotely detonated explosions, bombings, burnings, looting and ransacking.d) Illegal detention, ‘disappearance’ or torture of teachers, academics and education trade unionists, usually by forces of the state or forces supported by the state, though sometimes by rebel groups.e) Abduction of students, teachers and ofﬁ cials by armed forces for extortion or to spread terror; forced recruitment of child soldiers, and abduction and/or rape of school girls and teachers by military forces.The number and combination of tactics used varies between conﬂ ict situations. In Thailand, two of the main tactics are targeted assassination of known teachers by motorcycle pillion passengers wielding a pistol; another is bombings targeted at buses carrying armed guards and teachers. In Iraq, there have been many large-scale bombings using remotely detonated devices at universities, causing dozens of deaths in one blast, as well as shootings and kidnappings. In Afghanistan, burning down schools has been the predominant tactic but there have also been explosions and missile attacks. Two conﬂ icts involving a clash between left- and right-wing ideologies – in Colombia and Nepal – have included many incidents of illegal detention, disappearance and torture, usually by state or state-backed forces, as well as abduction by guerrillas. Left-right struggles have also made education trade unionists prime targets for these tactics, as in Colombia and Ethiopia.33 In Colombia, landmines laid by guerrilla groups and unexploded ordnance on school premises represent a grave and growing concern.34
